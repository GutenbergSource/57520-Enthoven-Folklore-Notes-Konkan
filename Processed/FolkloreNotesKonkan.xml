It is believed by the Br&#225;hmans that once an image is consecrated and worshipped, it should be worshipped uninterruptedly every day, and he who neglects to worship such an image daily incurs the sin of <hi>Brahma-hatya</hi> or Br&#225;hman-murder. For this reason Br&#225;hmans generally do not worship minor local deities. In former times Br&#225;hmans who worshipped these deities were excommunicated by their caste-men. Such <hi>Puj&#225;ris</hi> were compelled to wear a folded <hi>dhotur</hi> or waist cloth, and were forbidden to put on the <hi>gandh</hi> or sandal paste mark in straight or cross lines. They were allowed to put on the <hi>tila</hi> or circular mark of sandal paste. Another reason why Br&#225;hmans are not the <hi>Puj&#225;ris</hi> or worshippers of such deities is that Br&#225;hmans cannot accept or partake of the <hi>Naivedya</hi> offering of cooked food, fowls, etc., made to them. Lower class people can partake of such offerings, and are therefore generally the worshippers or ministrants of minor local deities.
</p><p>At Palshet in the Ratn&#225;giri District, there are two <hi>gr&#225;mdevis</hi>, viz., Jhol&#225;i and Mh&#225;rj&#225;i, and the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of these deities are respectively a Gurav and a Mah&#225;r.<note n="1">School Master, Palshet, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of goddesses are generally men of the lower castes. The guardian goddesses of the villages of Pule, Varavade, Nandivade, and Rila have Kunbis as their <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi>; while the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of the goddesses Mah&#225;lakshmi, Bhagvati, Mah&#225;k&#225;li, and Jog&#225;i are generally chosen from the Gurav caste.<note n="2">School Master, <corr sic="Adiv&#225;re">Adivare</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Konkan the R&#225;uls (Shudras) are the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of the deities Vithoba, Ravaln&#225;th and Bhav&#225;ni; the Gh&#225;dis are the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of the deities S&#225;teri and Khavaneshwar; while the deities Mah&#225;dev and M&#225;ruti are worshipped by <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> belonging to the Gurav caste.<note n="3">School Master, Parule, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The goddesses Makhajan and Jakhm&#225;ta at Sangameshwar in the Ratn&#225;giri District are worshipped by <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> who belong to the Gurav and Bhoi castes respectively. The god Ganpati at Makhnele has for his <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> a W&#225;ni. The <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of the temple of Shiva at L&#225;nje in the Ratn&#225;giri District are W&#225;nis.<note n="4">School Master, Makhnele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> It is said that the <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of Pund&#225;rik at Pandharpur is a Kir&#225;ta (fisherman) by caste.<note n="5">School Master, R&#225;j&#225;pur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of the goddess Narm&#225;ta at Sidgad in the Th&#225;na District is a Koli; whilst the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of K&#225;noba, Khandoba, and Vet&#225;l are of the lower castes.<note n="6">School Masters, <corr sic="&#193;g&#225;shi">Ag&#225;shi</corr> and Arn&#225;la, <corr sic="Th&#225;n&#225;">Th&#225;na</corr>.</note> The goddesses Mah&#225;lakshmi of Kolvan and Vajreshvari have their <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> chosen from the lower castes.<note n="7">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d, Th&#225;na.</note> The <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of Jari-Mari, Mhasoba, Bahiroba, Cheda and other deities which are said to prevent contagious diseases, are always men of the lower castes.<note n="8">School Master, Shah&#225;pur, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of the guardian goddesses of the villages Petsai, Dasgaum and Niz&#225;mpur are a Mah&#225;r, a Kumbh&#225;r or potter, and a Mar&#225;tha, respectively.<note n="9">School Master, Dasgaum, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of the <pb id="pb2" n="2"/>guardian goddesses of Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District belongs to the lower castes.<note n="1">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The goddess M&#225;ng&#225;i has always a Mah&#225;r as her <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi>.<note n="2">School Master, Akola, Kol&#225;ba.</note> Everyday the god Shiva is required to be worshipped first by a <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of the Gurav caste. The <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of Bahiri, a corruption of the word Bhairav, one of the manifestations of Shiva, is a man belonging to the lower castes. Similarly the <hi>puj&#225;ris</hi> of Bhagavati, Bhav&#225;ni, Ambika, K&#225;lika, J&#225;kh&#225;i, Jhol&#225;i, Janni, Kolh&#225;i, Vady&#225;j&#225;i, Shital&#225;devi, Chandika, etc., are persons belonging to lower castes.<note n="3">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>It is considered by the Hindus very meritorious and holy to worship the Sun; and by Br&#225;hmans the Sun is considered to be their chief deity. The <hi>G&#225;yatri Mantra</hi> of the Br&#225;hmans is a prayer to the Sun-god or the Savita Dev, and the Br&#225;hmans offer <hi>arghya</hi> or oblations of water to the Sun thrice a day. Those who want health, wealth and prosperity propitiate the Sun-god by prayers and ceremonies. The <hi>Ratha Saptami</hi> is considered to be the principal day for special worship and festivities in honour of the Sun-god. On this day, on a low wooden stool, is drawn, in red sandal paste, a figure of the Sun in human shape seated in a chariot drawn by seven horses, or by a horse with seven faces. This figure is then placed in the sun-shine, and it is then worshipped by offering it <hi>arghya</hi> or spoonfuls of water, red powder, red flowers mixed with red sandal paste, camphor, incense and fruits. Some people kneel down while offering the <hi>arghyas</hi> to the Sun. These <hi>arghyas</hi> are either three or twelve in number. Some persons make a vow not to eat anything unless they have worshipped the Sun and performed the twelve <hi>Namaskaras</hi> by falling prostrate and bowing with folded hands twelve times, and at each time repeating one of the twelve names of the Sun.<note n="A">These twelve names are:&#8212;1 Mitra, 2 Ravi, 3 Surya, 4 Bhanu, 5 Khaga, 6 Pushne, 7 Hiranyagarbha, 8 Marichi, 9 Aditya, 10 Savita, 11 Arka, 12 Bhasker.</note>
</p><p>In the Ratn&#225;giri District some people worship the Sun on the Sundays of the month of <hi>Shr&#225;van</hi>. A ceremony held on the <hi>Rathasaptami</hi> day, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 7th day of the bright half of <hi>M&#225;gh</hi>, is deemed a special festival in honour of the Sun-god. On that day people draw, on a small wooden stool, an image of the Sun, seated in a chariot drawn by seven horses, and worship it with great reverence. Milk is then boiled on a fire made of cow-dung cakes in front of the household <hi>Tulsi</hi> plant. If the milk overflows to the east, it is believed that there will be abundance of crops, but if it flows to the west it is taken as a sign of the near approach of famine.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Phonden">Phonde</corr>.</note> The Sun-god is also worshipped on the following occasions, <hi>e.g.</hi>, <hi>Trikal</hi>, <hi>Gajacch&#225;ya</hi>, <hi>Ardhodaya</hi>, <hi>Mahodaya</hi>, <hi>Vyatip&#225;t</hi>, <hi>Makar-Sankr&#225;nt</hi>, <hi>Kark-Sankr&#225;nt</hi> and the Solar eclipse.<note n="5">School Master, Devarukh.</note> Though there are few temples dedicated to the Sun, the village of Parule has the honour of having one called &#8220;the temple of Adi-N&#225;r&#225;yan.&#8221; Non-Br&#225;hmanical classes are not seen worshipping the Sun in this district, despite the fact that the Sun is said to be the embodiment of the three principal deities of the Hindus.<note n="6">School Master, Parule.</note>
</p><p>The people of the Th&#225;na District believe that the <hi>Swastika</hi> is the central point of the helmet of the Sun, and a vow called the <hi>Swastika Vrata</hi> is held in its honor. A woman who observes this vow, draws a figure of the <hi>Swastika</hi> and worships it daily during the <hi><corr sic="Ch&#225;turm&#226;s">Ch&#225;turm&#225;s</corr></hi> (four months of the rainy season), at the expiration of which she gives a Br&#225;hman a golden or silver plate with the sign of the Swastika upon it.<note n="7">School Master, Anjur.</note> Another vow named <hi>Dhanurm&#225;s</hi>, common to all districts in the Konkan, requires a person to complete his daily rites before sun-rise, and to offer a <pb id="pb3" n="3"/>preparation of food called <hi>Khichadi</hi> to the Sun-god. The observer of this vow then partakes of the food, regarding it as a gift from that god. This is either done for one day or repeated for a month till the <hi>Dhanu-Sankr&#225;nt</hi>.<note n="1">School Master, Vasind.</note> On the <hi>Somavati-Am&#225;v&#225;sya</hi> day (the 15th day of the dark half of a month falling on Monday), and the <hi>Kapil&#225;shasthi</hi> day, the Sun is held in especial reverence.<note n="2">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d.</note> A curious story is narrated regarding the offering of <hi>Arghya</hi> to the Sun. It is said that the Sun rejoices at the birth of a Br&#225;hman, and gives 1,000,000 cows in charity, believing that the <hi>Arghya</hi> which the Br&#225;hman will offer later on will devour his foes, one drop of the <hi>Arghya</hi> killing 1,000 of them<note n="A">33,000,0000 demons are said to be born every day to impede the journey of the Sun.</note>. The repetition of the <hi>G&#225;yatri-mantra</hi> 108 times a day is supposed to release a Br&#225;hman from the debt of 1,000,000 cows owed in this way to the Sun.<note n="3">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d.</note> The <hi>Yoga-Sutras</hi> of P&#225;tanjali however prohibit a man from looking at the setting Sun, though the sin thus incurred is made amends for by the offering of <hi>Arghya</hi> to that god.<note n="4">School Masters, <corr sic="Agashi">Ag&#225;shi</corr> and <corr sic="Arnala">Arn&#225;la</corr>.</note> It is interesting to note that women do not grind corn on the <hi>Ratha-Saptami</hi> day.<note n="5">School Master, Padaghe.</note>
</p><p>Women bow down to the Sun on the 11th, 12th, 30th or 40th day after their delivery; but Kunbi women generally worship that god on the 7th day.<note n="6">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> On this occasion some women show a churning handle<note n="B">The churning handle or rod is called in Mar&#225;thi <hi>Ravi</hi>, which is one of the names of the Sun.</note> to the Sun-god and offer him some grains of rice.<note n="7">School Master, Nevare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>Swastika</hi> is considered so holy in the Konkan that it is always drawn on the <hi>Antarpat</hi>; and at the time of the <hi>Puny&#225;ha Wachan</hi> ceremony which precedes a Hindu wedding, a <hi>Swastika</hi> drawn in rice is worshipped.<note n="8">School Master, Mithb&#225;v, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The principal deities of the Hindus, whenever they are invoked on special occasions, are seated on the <hi>Swastika</hi>.<note n="9">School Master, Makhanele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The people of the Ratn&#225;giri District worship the <hi>Swastika</hi>, regarding it as the symbol as well as the seat of the Sun-god.<note n="10">School Master, Pendhur, M&#225;lvan, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>By some the <hi>Swastika</hi> is regarded as the foundation-stone of the universe<note n="11">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la.</note> and is held to be the symbol of the god Shiva, and not of the Sun.<note n="12">School Masters, Chauk, Karjat, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>The conception of Kunbi is said to have taken place by the influence of the rays of the Sun.<note n="13">School Masters, Chauk, Karjat, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>Swastika</hi> is considered as an emblem of peace and prosperity, and for this reason Br&#225;hman women draw a figure of the <hi>Swastika</hi> in front of their houses.<note n="14"><corr sic="Rao">R&#225;o</corr> <corr sic="Saheb">S&#225;heb</corr> Shelke.</note> The custom of moving round such sacred objects as the Banyan, the <hi>Pipal</hi>, the <hi>Tulsi</hi> or sweet basil plant, the <hi>Umbar</hi>, the <hi>Avala</hi> (Phylanthus emblica), etc., is prevalent in the district of Kolh&#225;pur. There are no cases recorded in which women after child-birth are exposed to the Sun. But on the 12th day after her delivery, the mother puts on new bangles and new clothes; cocoanuts, <corr sic="betel-nuts">betelnuts</corr> and leaves, grains of rice, plantains and grains of wheat are placed in her lap. She then comes out and bows to the Sun. Wealthy persons on this occasion perform a <hi>homa</hi> sacrifice in their houses by kindling the holy fire and feeding Br&#225;hmans. No one in this district believes that conception is caused, or is likely to be caused, by exposure to the rays of the Sun.
</p><p>The Hindu women of the Konkan walk round <hi>Pipal</hi>, <hi>Tulsi</hi>, and <hi>Umbar</hi> trees every Saturday and on the <hi>Somavati-am&#225;v&#225;sya</hi> day, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 15th day of the dark half of a month when it falls on Monday.<note n="15">School Master, Malgund, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Sometimes, however, women make a vow to walk round a <pb id="pb4" n="4"/>temple or a sacred tree one-hundred thousand times; and for the fulfilment of this vow they walk round the temple or tree for about seven or eight hours every day.

</p><p>The Moon is worshipped by the Hindus on the 2nd of the bright half of every month. On this day it is considered very lucky to see the moon, and many people, particularly the lower classes, pull out threads from the clothes they wear, and offer them to the moon, saying &#8220;O! God, accept these old clothes of ours and be pleased to give us new ones in their stead.&#8221; Some people worship the moon on the <hi>Sankasti Chaturthi</hi><corr>,</corr> 4th day of the dark half of every month; and such people will not eat anything until they have seen and worshipped the moon on that day. The moon is not worshipped on the <hi>Ganesh Chaturthi</hi> day that is, the 4th of the bright half of the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapad</hi>, as it is considered very unlucky to see the moon on that night. It is firmly believed that any one who sees the moon on the <hi>Ganesh Chaturthi</hi> day even by accident will be falsely accused of theft or some other crime. In order to avoid this, people who have accidently seen the moon, throw stones at the houses of their neighbours, and if the neighbours abuse them in return, the mischief makers consider themselves freed by the abuse from the sin of having looked at the moon on a forbidden night.
</p><p>The spots on the surface of the moon are believed by some to be the <hi>rath</hi> or chariot of the god. Others think that they are lunar mountains; but many believe that the spots are the visible signs of the stain on the character of the moon-god due to his having outraged the modesty of the wife of his <hi>guru</hi>, the god Brahaspati or Jupiter. In the <hi>Pur&#225;ns</hi> it is stated that on one occasion, a dispute arose between the moon and Brahaspati or Jupiter about the wife of Brahaspati, each of them claiming to be the cause of her conception. Subsequently a son was born who was named Budha (Mercury). Brahaspati&#8217;s wife, on being asked who was the father of the child, named the moon. Thereupon Brahaspati cursed the moon for his adultery. The spots on the surface of the moon are said to be the effect of this curse.
</p><p>The moon-god is believed to distribute nectar through his rays, and therefore this deity is said to have the power of removing diseases and restoring human beings to health. The moon is the king of herbs, and all trees, plants, etc., thrive owing to the influence of the moon. Sometimes people place at night, figs, plantains, sugarcane and other eatables in the moon-light and eat them early in the morning; and it is said that those who do so improve in health. The practice of drinking the moon&#8217;s rays does not prevail in the Kolh&#225;pur district. But people occasionally dine in the moon light.<note n="2"><corr sic="Rao">R&#225;o</corr> <corr sic="Sahib">S&#225;hib</corr> Shelke.</note>
</p><p>On a full moon day people perform the special worship of their chosen deity. On the full moon of the month of <hi>K&#225;rtika</hi> temples are illuminated, and on the full moon day of <hi>M&#225;gha</hi>, raw corn such as wheat, <hi>b&#225;jri</hi>, etc., is cooked and offered to the household and other deities.<note n="A">In the Konkan the <hi>Nav&#225;nna Purnima</hi> or full moon day of new food is observed in the month of <hi><corr sic="Ashwina">Ashvina</corr></hi>. This is, no doubt, due to the difference in the season of the harvest.</note> On this day are also performed the special rites and ceremonies that are required in connection with the <hi>Kula-devat&#225;s</hi> or family gods or goddesses. On the full moon day of <hi>F&#225;lguna</hi> the <hi>Holi</hi> fire is kindled and worshipped. In certain families the full moon of <hi>Chaitra</hi> is considered auspicious for making offerings to family deities. On the full moon day of <hi>Shr&#225;van</hi> is observed the feast of Cocoanut day, and on this day Br&#225;hmans put on new sacred threads. The full moon is considered by the <hi>Sany&#225;sis</hi> or ascetics an auspicious day for shaving their heads.
<pb id="pb5" n="5"/></p><p>On the new moon day the <hi>Pitras</hi> or Manes are worshipped. Lighted lamps are worshipped on the new moon day, of <hi>Ash&#225;dha</hi>.

Nectar is supposed to have been derived from the rays of the moon; and in some sacred books it is stated that the Chakora bird (Bartavelle Partridge) drinks the rays of the moon.<note n="8">School Master, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The people of the Th&#225;na District hold similar notions regarding the spots on the surface of the moon. It has been said by some that the portion in question represents mud, while others say that the moon has been disfigured owing to a curse from a sage.<note n="9">School Master, Murb&#225;d.</note> Some people say that the spots are due to the moon being cursed by his preceptor Brahaspati with whose wife the moon-god had connection. Being unable to bear the pain of the spots, the moon, it is said, propitiated his preceptor, who directed him to bathe in the Bhima river to alleviate the agony. Accordingly the pain was assuaged, and the part of the river where the Moon-god bathed thus came to be called <hi>Chandra bh&#225;ga</hi>.<note n="10">School Master, V&#225;sind, S&#225;h&#225;pur.</note> Some persons suggest that the spots are a <hi>Pipal</hi> tree with two deer feeding upon it from two sides.<note n="11">School Master, W&#225;da.</note> Others hold that the spots on the surface of the moon are due to its having been kicked by a deer which, when pursued by a hunter, was refused shelter.<note n="12">School Master, <corr sic="Edvan">Edwan</corr>, M&#225;him.</note> <pb id="pb6" n="6"/>The people of the Th&#225;na District believe that the rays of the moon influence conception.<note n="1">School Master, Kaly&#225;n, No. 1 and School Master, Padaghe, <corr sic="Bhivandi">Bhiwandi</corr>.</note>

</p><p>People have various ideas about the cause of the eclipses of the sun and the moon. Some say that the sun and the moon are superior deities, and that the demons R&#225;hu and Ketu who belong to the caste of M&#225;ngs attempt to touch them and to devour them. Others believe that the planets R&#225;hu and Ketu stand in the path of the Sun and the Moon and thereby darkness is caused on the earth. It is believed that about 5 hours before the commencement of the obscuration, in the case of the Sun and about 4 hours in the case of the Moon, the <hi>Vedha</hi> or malign influence of the monsters begins and during the period till the whole eclipse is over a strict fast is observed. At the commencement of the eclipse, as well as at its close, people bathe. Some sit on a low wooden stool with a rosary in their hands repeating the names of the gods, or the <hi>g&#225;yatri</hi> or some of the <hi>mantras</hi>. But those who want to acquire the art of magic or witch-craft or the power of removing the evil effects of snake-poison, or scorpion sting, go to a lonely place on the riverside, and there standing in water repeat the <hi>mantras</hi> taught to them by their <hi>guru</hi> or teacher. People give alms to Mah&#225;rs and M&#225;ngs on this occasion, and therefore persons of this class go about the streets saying loudly &#8220;Give us alms and the eclipse will be over<corr>.</corr>&#8221; <hi>De d&#225;n sut&#233; gir&#225;n.</hi>
</p><p>A strict fast is observed on an eclipse day, but children and pregnant women who cannot bear the privation are given something to eat under a <hi>sike</hi>.

On that occasion the people of the Konkan resort to the following expedient in order to ascertain whether the luminary is eclipsed or not. They take a potful of water and hold in it a <hi>musal</hi>. If it stands in the pot unsupported it is regarded as indicative of the existence of an eclipse. M&#225;ngs, Mah&#225;rs, etc., are supposed to be the descendants of R&#225;hu and Ketu; and for this reason gifts are made to them in charity on an eclipse day.<note n="8">School Master, Khetwadi, A.V.

A barren woman is also beaten with the same motive. Similarly many other superstitious beliefs are connected with an eclipse.

</p><p>The planets and stars are worshipped by the Hindus. It is believed that a person who is to die within six months cannot see the polar star. From the movements of the planets past and future events of one&#8217;s career are foretold by Br&#225;hman and other astrologers. And as it is believed that man&#8217;s good and bad luck are dependant upon the influence of the planets, offerings of various kinds are made and sacrifices performed for securing the favour of the <hi>Navagrahas</hi> or the nine planets. In order to avert the effect of the evil influence of certain planets people sometimes wear rings of those precious stones which are supposed to be the favourites of the planets.
</p><p>The <corr sic="rainbow">rain-bow</corr> is called <hi>Indra dhanushya</hi> or the Indra&#8217;s bow, and it is believed that if the rain-bow appears in the east, it indicates the coming of more rain, and if it appears in the west it is a sure sign of the close of the monsoon.

The king consented, whereupon the god W&#225;man enlarged his body to such an extent that by his one footstep he occupied the whole earth and by the second he occupied heaven. Upon this the god Brahma worshipped the foot of the god Vishnu which was in heaven, and from that foot sprang the heavenly Ganges which flows in heaven and is called Dudha Ganga or the milky Ganges.
</p><p>The worship of stars and planets is in vogue among Konkan Hindu families of the higher castes. The polar star in particular is seen and worshipped by the bride and the bridegroom after the ceremony at the marriage altar is over.<note n="8">School Master, Makhanele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> A very interesting story is connected with the polar star. By the great power of his penance the sage Vishv&#225;mitra despatched king Trishanku to Heaven, but the gods hurled him down. Thereupon Vishv&#225;mitra became enraged and began to create a new heaven. Hindu mythological books say that he thus created the sages Vashista, Angiras, Pulah, Pulastya, Rutu, Atri, and Marichi, and stationed Trishanku in the sky. The <hi>Nava-grahas</hi> or the nine planets are worshipped before the commencement of all important ceremonies.<note n="9">School Master, Devarukh, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> A cluster of seven stars called the <hi>Sapta-rishis</hi> are worshipped by men at the time of the <hi>Shr&#225;vani</hi> ceremony, while women worship them on the 5th day of the bright half of <pb id="pb10" n="10"/><hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi>.<note n="1">School Master, Makhanele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> These <hi>Sapta-rishis</hi> are said to have been created by the God Brahma from his own body; and teaching them the four Vedas, he handed them over to them and asked them to regulate the affairs of the world.<note n="2">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Some people of the Ratn&#225;giri District believe that the rain-bow is the bow used by R&#225;ma, the hero of the R&#225;m&#225;yana. Its appearance on the east is regarded by them as symptomatic of the approach of rain, while its appearance on the west is equivalent to the departure of rain.<note n="3">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The short duration of the rain-bow is held to indicate an excessive fall of rain while its long duration forbodes a scarcity of rain.<note n="4">School Master, Makhanele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The appearance of the rain-bow on a river is supposed to indicate the approach of rain, while its appearance on a mountain means the departure of rain.<note n="5">School Master, Navare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Of the two bows of which the rain-bow seems to be composed, the larger is believed to belong to R&#225;ma, and the smaller to Lakshman.<note n="6">School Master, Adivare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Since the God Indra is supposed to send rain, the <hi>Indradhanushya</hi> (the rain-bow) is regarded as a sign of the advent of rain.<note n="7">School Master, Malgund, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>By some Hindus it is believed that the milky way is a heavenly river which is a favourite bathing place of the gods.<note n="8">School Master, Kankavli, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Others suppose it to be a branch of the celestial Ganges which is said to have been brought down upon this earth by king Bhagiratha.<note n="9">School Master, Makhanele, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Some persons, however, believe that since the great sage Agastya is said to reside at R&#225;meshwar in the southern direction, the Ganges (the milky way) runs through the sky to the south in order to bathe him. Sometimes the milky way is believed to be a white cloud.<note n="10">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>On the authority of the Mah&#225;k&#225;la Nirv&#225;n Tantra, some people of the Th&#225;na District believe that a person who cannot get a view of the polar star will die within six months; while others substitute the <hi>Arundhati</hi> star for the polar star and determine the duration of life of a diseased person by the same process.<note n="11">School Master, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The people of the Th&#225;na District believe that the rain-bow is caused by the accumulation of moisture in the air.<note n="12">School Master, Rai, Th&#225;na.</note> The rain-bow is said to consecrate the region over which it appears.<note n="13">School Master, Badlapur, Th&#225;na.</note> The appearance of the rain-bow in the morning is supposed to forbode the approach of rain.<note n="14">School Master, Mokhada, Th&#225;na.</note>

Others, however, believe that it represents God Indra who assumes that form to see how his orders are executed by his subordinates.<note n="18">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The rain-bow is said to foretell good if it appears either at the beginning or end of the rainy season, while its appearance at any other time is supposed to forbode evil.<note n="19">School Master, Vavanje, Kol&#225;ba.</note>

</p><p>Various conflicting notions are entertained regarding thunder and lightning. The people of the Ratn&#225;giri District believe that the clouds are animals that roar. When these animals emit water it bursts forth on account of the circular motion of the winds called Chanda and Munda.

In the Konkan it is not held sinful to ascend a mountain or a hill, though to sit upon its summit is considered sinful.<note n="11">School Master, B&#225;ndivade, Budruk, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The hill of Mirya near Ratn&#225;giri is considered sacred. This hill is believed to be a particle (<hi>miri</hi>) of the mythological mountain Dronagiri.<note n="12">School Master, M&#225;lgund, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>A hill near Dh&#225;r&#225;vi in the Th&#225;na District is consecrated by the temple of a goddess upon the top. This goddess is said to preserve ships at sea, and people are occasionally possessed by her. It is said that a Roman Catholic priest met instantaneous death on having insulted her.<note n="13">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The hill of Mah&#225;lakshmi in the Dah&#225;nu t&#225;luka is held sacred. The villagers consider it dangerous to ascend this hill.<note n="14">School Master, Dah&#225;nu, Th&#225;na.</note> On the hill of the same name is a temple of the goddess Jivadhani, who is said to preserve children from small-pox. The following <pb id="pb16" n="16"/>story is told in connection with the goddess. A person in need of money used to place before her image as large a heap of flowers as he wanted gold, stating that he would return the gold when he had done with it. He used then to go home and return on an appointed day for the gold, which was sure to be found where he had placed the heap of flowers. Once a man failed to return the gold, and thenceforth the goddess withheld her bounty. There is no door to the temple of this goddess. It is only through a hole in a big stone that one can have a view of her image. Sweet scent is said to be continually emitted from this hole. The goddess is said to have fastened the door of her temple for the following reason. One day the goddess was walking at the foot of the hill at night. A cowherd who happened to be there was bewitched by her matchless beauty and fell a prey to evil desire. He pursued her to the top of the hill, when the goddess, divining his motive, fastened the door of her temple with a prodigious stone. On the same hill is a cattle shed in which fresh cow-dung is said to be always found. This place being inaccessible to cows and other quadrupeds, the people believe that the goddess keeps a cow of her own.<note n="1">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The hill of Tungar is consecrated by the temple of a certain goddess upon it. There is also a very famous hill near Arn&#225;la, called the hill of Buddha. This hill was once the seat of a king belonging to the weaver caste. Recently a pond was discovered upon it, in which was found a stone-box containing a begging-pot and a diamond. A great fair is held annually on the hill of Motm&#225;vali near Bandra in the Th&#225;na district. The devotees of the deity are Hindus, Parsis, and Christians. It is said this goddess was once worshipped by Hindus only. A Br&#225;hman is the <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of the <hi>Pir</hi> on the hill of B&#225;ba Malang near Kaly&#225;n. It is said that the <hi>Pir</hi> has declared that no Moslem <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> should worship him. The Hindus and Moslems worship him alike.<note n="2">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note>

</p><p>At a short distance from Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District is a hill dedicated to the god Dattatraya, in whose honour a great fair is held annually. The following story is told in connection with this hill. In ancient times a Br&#225;hman used to practise austerities on this hill near a <hi>Tulsi</hi> plant (the place on which the present temple stands). He used to spend the whole day there, but returned home at nightfall. On his way home fearful scenes were often presented to him, and in his dreams he was asked not to go there any more. But the Br&#225;hman was obdurate. He persisted in his resolution to practise austerities for a number of years, and at last succeeded in obtaining a personal interview with the god Dattatraya, who commanded him to bow down to his feet (<hi>p&#225;duka</hi>). From that time pious men live on this hill and offer their prayers to the god Dattatraya. Nearly four hundred steps have been constructed for the ascent of this hill, and additional steps are being built every year. Here also are some springs of pure water. It is worth while to note that the <hi>puj&#225;ri</hi> of this god is a Shudra by caste.<note n="4">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> On the north-east side of the hill dedicated to the god Dattatraya stands the temple of the goddess Hingl&#225;j. To the north of this temple are four caves, while to the west is a deep den resembling a well, through which a lane appears to have been dug. This is said to be the road excavated by the P&#225;ndavas to enable them to go to K&#225;si.<note n="5">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At a distance of <pb id="pb17" n="17"/>two miles from Ak&#243;la in the Kol&#225;ba District is a hill called Mallik&#225;rjun. This is said to be a small stone fallen from the mythological mountain Dronagiri. This hill is said to contain many medical herbs.<note n="1">School Master, Akol, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The hill at Kankeshwar near Alib&#225;g is held sacred, and tradition says that in ancient times it had golden dust upon it.<note n="2">School Master, <corr sic="Sasavane">Sasawane</corr>, Kol&#225;ba.</note> A cave at Ambivali near Karjat in the Kol&#225;ba <corr sic="district">District</corr> consists of seven rooms, one of which is spacious enough to accommodate five hundred persons.

</p><p>The gods Indra and Varuna are supposed to send rain; but it is believed that the god Shiva in chief has the power of causing the fall of rain, and for this reason whenever there is a scarcity of rain people pour water over the <hi>linga</hi> of Shiva until the whole <hi>linga</hi> is submerged.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Mith Bav">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In order that there should be a fall of rain, some people besmear the <hi>linga</hi> of the god Shiva with cooked rice and curds.<note n="5">School Master, M&#225;lvan, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Ratn&#225;giri District, whenever there is a scarcity of rain, people go to the place known as Parashur&#225;m Kshetra, and there pray to the god Parashur&#225;m to send rain.<note n="6">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Sacrifices are also offered to Indra, the god of rain, in order that there should be plenty of rain.

</p><p>In the Ratn&#225;giri District the following ceremony is performed by the lower castes such as Kunbis, etc., to avert drought. All the male villagers assemble together at an appointed place, and there they select one of them as their <hi>Gowala-deva</hi>. All of them then go about in the village from house to house. The owner of every house sprinkles water over the assembly, and curds and butter-milk over the body of the Gowala-deva. They are also given some <hi>shidha</hi> consisting of rice, pulse, vegetables, etc. After visiting most of the houses in the village, the assembly headed by the Gowala-deva go to the bank of a river. Here they cook the food, offer it first to the Gowala-deva and then partake of the remainder as a <hi>pras&#225;d</hi> from the Gowala-deva.<note n="8">School Master, Phonde, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Some people make an image of the sage <hi>Shringarishi</hi> for the purpose of causing the fall of rain.<note n="9">School Master, Chiplun, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Others make an image of Dhondal-deva in order that there should be plenty of rain.<note n="10">School Master, Nevare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Sometimes people repeat <hi>mantras</hi> addressed to Parjanya (rain) so that rain should fall.<note n="11">School Master, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The goddess Navachandika is worshipped in order that there should be rain.

The leaves containing the water are then tied to the eaves of the house.<note n="13">School Master, <corr sic="B&#225;ndevade">B&#225;ndivade</corr>, Budruk, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The people say that during the rule of the Peshw&#225;s there was a class of <hi>mantris</hi> who had the power of causing a failure of rain.<note n="14">School Master, M&#225;lvan, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> To check the fall of rain, some people ask naked boys to throw burning <pb id="pb18" n="18"/>coals into the rain water.<note n="1">School Master, D&#225;bhol, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> <hi>Irale</hi> (a protection against rain, made of the leaves of trees) is kept in the rain upside down, the goddess Holika is worshipped, the boughs of the <hi>Avali</hi> tree are conveyed to a place where four roads meet and stones are heaped over it, and eaves of thatched houses are beaten by boys who do not wear clothes, all these being done by the villagers with a view to preventing an excessive fall of rain.<note n="2">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The people of the Th&#225;na District believe that distinct deities preside over distinct seasons, <hi>e.g.</hi>, Mars presides over the spring (Vasant), Venus over summer (Grishma), the moon over autumn (Varsha), Mercury over <hi>sharat</hi>, Saturn over winter (Hemant and Shishir).<note n="3">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note> When the people are in need of rain they say to the god of rain &#8220;Let us have plenty of rain to-morrow and we will give thee, Oh!

In order that there should be no scarcity of rain, some people perform the rites of <hi>Laghu-rudra</hi> and <hi>Mah&#225;-rudra</hi>.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Murbad">Murb&#225;d</corr>, Th&#225;na.</note> The following measure if adopted is said to cause rain.

</p><p>Some stones are supposed to have influence over rain fall. There is a big stone at Varasai in the Kol&#225;ba District on which are drawn certain images.

They ask a person of the Kaik&#225;di or Vadar caste to remain naked and break the string round his waist. A small image of black earth is made and placed upon his head. The boy then conveys the image from house to house in the village. A woman in each house sprinkles water over the image while the boy dances saying &#8220;<hi>Dhondil gajya, P&#225;us gajya</hi>.&#8221; It is believed that it rains in the direction in which the water sprinkled falls. A person who accompanies the boy gathers corn at every house. A dinner is then prepared, and the people of the caste to which the boy belongs, partake of it heartily. It is also said that making water in a standing posture causes the fall of rain.<note n="8">School Master, Akol, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The god R&#225;meshwar at Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District is said to have control over rain.

</p><p>(5) The <hi>W&#225;studevat&#225;s</hi> or <hi>Grihadevat&#225;s</hi>, that is, the class of deity which presides over the house and is established at the time of the housewarming or <hi>W&#225;stu</hi> ceremony.
</p><p>The principal <hi>Gr&#225;ma-devat&#225;s</hi> are Hanum&#225;n or M&#225;ruti, K&#225;lika, Amba, W&#225;ghoba, Chedoba, Mhasoba, Bahiroba or Bhairav, Ganesh, Vira, Mh&#225;lsa or Maha Lakshmi, Ch&#225;munda, Vet&#225;l, Khandoba Malh&#225;ri Jog&#225;i, Bhaw&#225;ni, and W&#225;geshwari and Shiva. In most villages the chief village god is M&#225;ruti or Hanum&#225;n, whose temple is situated at the entrance of the village. M&#225;ruti is considered to be an <hi>avat&#225;r</hi> or incarnation of Shiva, and is held in great reverence by all classes. A festival or <hi>jatra</hi> is held in honour of Hanum&#225;n on the bright half of the month of <hi>Chaitra</hi>. On this occasion the temple is decorated with ever-greens, and flowers, the stone image of the god is newly painted or covered with red lead and oil, and garlands of the <hi>Rui</hi> (Gigantic snake wort) flowers are placed round the neck of the image, cocoanuts, plantains, <corr sic="betel-nuts">betelnuts</corr> and leaves are offered to the god, camphor is lighted and waved round the image, incense is burnt, cooked food and sweets are offered, and money presents are made.

It is for this reason, the people say, that every village in the Konkan and on the Gh&#225;ts has a temple of M&#225;ruti.<note n="3">School Master, Kamathipura, Bombay.</note> The god M&#225;ruti is worshipped in the village of W&#225;sind on Tuesdays and Saturdays.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Washind">W&#225;sind</corr>, Th&#225;na.</note> In former days it was customary to establish an image of the god M&#225;ruti in a newly built castle or fort.<note n="5">School Master, Umela, Th&#225;na.</note> Hanum&#225;n, the son of Anjani and the wind or M&#225;rut, is known for his loyalty to his master <pb id="pb22" n="22"/>and for his bravery.

Every Hindu village or locality is supposed to possess at least one temple of the god M&#225;ruti, and in Mah&#225;r&#225;shtra M&#225;ruti is the guardian of every village.

Women desirous of getting children go to the temple of M&#225;ruti, and there burn before his image lamps made of wheat flour and filled with ghi. The image of Hanum&#225;n is represented in temples in two ways, that is (1) V&#237;ra Hanum&#225;n or Warrior Hanum&#225;n, (2) D&#225;sa-Hanum&#225;n or servant Hanum&#225;n. The former is found in a temple consecrated to the worship of the god Hanum&#225;n alone, whereas the latter is found in a temple dedicated to the worship of the god R&#225;ma.<note n="1">School Masters, Ag&#225;shi and Arn&#225;la, Th&#225;na.</note> Since M&#225;ruti is the god of strength, gymnasts tie an image of M&#225;ruti to their wrists, and they also consecrate an image of M&#225;ruti in their gymnasiums. The number eleven is said to be dear and sacred to him because he is believed to be an incarnation of the eleven Rudras. The birth day of the god M&#225;ruti which falls on the 15th of the bright half of <hi>Chaitra</hi>, called the <hi>Hanum&#225;n Jayanti</hi> day, is celebrated in the Kolh&#225;pur District with great reverence. Those who wish to have a son draw the figure of M&#225;ruti on a wall in red-lead, and worship it daily with sandal paste, flowers and garlands of <hi>Rui</hi>. Others burn lamps made of wheat flour before the image of the god. Persons who are under the evil influence of the planets, and especially of the <corr sic="planets">planet</corr> Saturn, worship the god Hanum&#225;n on Saturdays in order to propitiate the planets. On this day they make wreaths of the leaves and flowers of the <hi>Rui</hi> plant and adorn his neck with them. They also offer him <hi>udid</hi> (Phaseolus radiatus) and salt. The story told of M&#225;ruti is that Anjani his mother pleased the god Shiva with her penance, and when the god asked her to claim a boon, she requested that Shiva himself should be born as her son. Shiva therefore took birth in her womb and manifested himself as Hanum&#225;n or M&#225;ruti<note n="2">School Master, Samangad, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>.
</p><p>The Local deities are generally found in special localities or sacred places called <hi>Kshetras</hi> or <hi>Punya sth&#225;nas</hi>. Thus the god R&#225;ma at N&#225;sik, Vithoba at Pandharpur, Krishna at Dw&#225;rka, Mah&#225;lakshmi at Kolwan, <corr sic="W&#225;greshwari">W&#225;jreshwari</corr> at Nirmal (Th&#225;na), Mharloba in the Ratn&#225;giri, Shitala devi at Kelwa M&#225;him, and Khandoba or Khander&#225;i at Jejuri.
</p><p>Khander&#225;i is said to be an incarnation of the god Shiva. Khander&#225;i killed the demon Mani-Malla who was devastating the earth, and he is therefore called Mall&#225;ri or Malh&#225;ri. Kunbis and lower class Hindus in the Konkan as well as in the Deccan occasionally make a vow to the god Khandoba that if their desire is fulfilled they will offer their first born male or female child to the service of the god. The male child thus dedicated to Khandoba is called W&#225;ghya and the female is called Murali. The W&#225;ghya and Murali do not engage in any business, but maintain themselves by begging in the streets in the name of the god Khander&#225;i. Though they are not actually married, the <corr sic="W&#225;ghy&#225;s">W&#225;ghyas</corr> and Muralis live as husband and wife, and their progeny are also called W&#225;ghyas and Muralis. They repeat the sacred cry <hi>jai khander&#225;y&#225;cha Elkot</hi>, and give to people <hi>bel-bhand&#225;r</hi> of Khander&#225;i consisting of the sacred <hi>Bel</hi> leaves and turmeric powder. The god Khander&#225;i is the family deity of some Deshasth Br&#225;hmans, who perform a family rite <pb id="pb23" n="23"/>called <hi>Tali bharane</hi> <foreign lang="ma" xml:lang="ma">&#2340;&#2355;&#2368; &#2349;&#2352;&#2339;&#2375;</foreign> on every <hi>purnima</hi> or full moon day. The rite is as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>A <hi>tali</hi> or plate is filled with cocoanuts, fruits, betel nuts, saffron, turmeric or <hi><corr sic="bel-bh&#225;nd&#225;r">bel-bhand&#225;r</corr></hi>, etc. Then a pot is filled with water, and on its mouth a cocoanut is placed. This cocoanut, with the pot, is then worshipped with flowers, sandal paste, etc., a lighted lamp filled with ghi is put in the same place, and the <hi>tali</hi> is waved thrice round the pot, which is supposed to contain the god Khandoba. Five persons then lift up the cocoanut with the <hi>tali</hi> and place it three times on the pot, repeating each time the words <hi>Elkot</hi> or <hi>Khande r&#225;y&#225;cha Elkot</hi>. The cocoanut is then broken into pieces, mixed with sugar or <hi>j&#225;gri</hi>, and is distributed among friends and relations as <hi>pras&#225;d</hi>. On this occasion, as well as on the occasions of all <hi>Kuladharmas</hi>, that is, the days fixed for performing the special worship of the family goddess or family god of each family, the ceremony called the <hi>Gondhal</hi> dance is performed. On the same occasion another ceremony called <hi>Bodan</hi> is performed by the Deshasths and by the Chitp&#225;vans. It is as follows:&#8212; An image of the family deity is placed in a pot or plate called <hi>t&#225;mhan</hi>, and it is then bathed in the <hi>panch&#225;mrit</hi>, that is, the five holy things, <hi>viz.</hi>, milk, curds, ghi, honey and sugar. Sandalpaste is offered to it as well as flowers, lighted lamps and some sweets and incense. Five women whose husbands are alive then prepare five lamps of wheat flour called <hi>Kuranandi</hi> and wave them thrice round the face of the goddess or god, as the case may be. All the limps are then placed in the plate or <hi>t&#225;mhan</hi> in which the deity is kept, and the <hi>panch&#225;mrita</hi> and other materials of worship and food and sweet cakes are mixed together. Occasionally one of the five women becomes possessed with the spirit of the <hi>kula-devi</hi> or family deity, and confers blessings on the members of the family for their devotion. It is believed that those families which fail to perform periodically the <hi>Bodan</hi>, <hi>Tali</hi> and <hi>Gondhal</hi> ceremonies in honour of their tutelary deity are sure to suffer, from some misfortune or calamity during the year.<note n="1">School Master, Pol&#225;dpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The local deities chiefly worshipped at Chaul, Kol&#225;ba District, are Hingl&#225;j, Jakhm&#225;ta, Bhagawati, Champ&#225;wati, Mahik&#225;wati, and Golamba-devi. At the sowing and reaping times, people of the lower castes offer fowls and goats to these deities, and Br&#225;hmans offer cocoanuts.<note n="2">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The local deity of the village W&#225;vashi near Pen in the Kol&#225;ba District is said to possess the power of averting evil, and is accordingly held in great respect by the people of many villages in the District. Every third year a great fair is held, and a buffalo is sacrificed to the goddess on the full moon day of the month of <hi>Chaitra</hi>. The <hi>Puj&#225;ri</hi> of this goddess is a Gurav.<note n="3">School Master, <corr sic="W&#225;vshi">W&#225;vashi</corr>, Kol&#225;ba.</note> Another celebrated <hi>Sth&#225;na-deva</hi> in the Kol&#225;ba District is Bahiri-Somajai of Khopoli.

Sacrifices of goats, fowls and cocoanuts are made to this goddess at the time of sowing and reaping. The <hi>Puj&#225;ris</hi> of this deity are known as Shingade Guravs.<note n="4">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The worship of the local deity B&#225;pdev is much in favour among the villages of Apta and the surrounding places.

The <hi>Puj&#225;ri</hi> is generally a Gurav or <corr sic="Mar&#225;th&#225;">Mar&#225;tha</corr> Kunbi. On every full moon day cocoanuts are offered, and on the occasions of sowing and reaping, goats and fowls are sacrificed to this deity.<note n="1">School Master, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Devgad there is a temple of the goddess Gaj&#225;b&#225;i on the sea shore. The <hi>Puj&#225;ri</hi> of this goddess is a man of the Gh&#225;di caste. On the first day of the bright half of the month of <hi>M&#225;rgashirsh</hi> (December) special offerings of goats, fowls and cocoanuts are made by the villagers.<note n="2">School Master, Devgad, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The deities <corr sic="Ravalnath">Ravaln&#225;th</corr>, M&#225;uli, Vet&#225;l, R&#225;meshwar and Hanum&#225;n are usually worshipped in most villages in Ratn&#225;giri. The villagers in the Ratn&#225;giri District have great faith in their local deities, and before undertaking any important business they obtain the consent or take the omen of the deity. This ceremony is known as <hi>kaul gh&#225;lne</hi> and it is performed as follows:&#8212;Two betel nuts or flowers are taken and one of them is placed on the right side of the deity and the other on the left side. The worshipper then bows before the deity and requests her to let the nut on the right side fall first if the deity is pleased to consent, if not, to let the nut on the left side fall first. Naturally one of the two nuts falls first, and they interpret this as either consent or dissent as the case may be. The villagers have so much faith in this <hi>kaul</hi> that they make use of this method of divination to ascertain whether sick or diseased persons will recover or die. Special sacrifices are offered to these local deities whenever an epidemic like cholera occurs.<note n="3">School Master, Parule, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Ratn&#225;giri District, at many places, there are <hi>Swayambhu</hi> or natural <hi>lingas</hi> of the god Shiva, and over these places temples are built. The <hi>Puj&#225;ris</hi> of these temples are generally Jangams or Lingayat Guravs. No animal sacrifices are made at these shrines.<note n="4">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At a short distance from the village of Makhamle there is a temple of the god Shiva called Amn&#225;yeshwar. The following legend is narrated in connection with this temple:&#8212;The place where the present temple stands once abounded with <hi>Amani</hi> trees and formed a pasture for cattle. The cow of a certain man of the village daily used to go to graze at this place. The cow used to give milk twice, but one day she gave milk only once, and thereafter she continued to give milk only once a day. The owner therefore asked the <hi>Gavali</hi> or cowherd to ascertain the cause of this sudden change. One day the cowherd noticed that the cow allowed her milk to drop upon a stone. At this the cowherd was so enraged that he struck the stone with his scythe so hard that it was cloven in two and blood gushed forth. He hurriedly repaired to the village and related this wonderful phenomenon to the people. The villagers came to the spot, and decided to build a temple to the god Shiva over the stone. One part of the stone is in this temple and the other part was taken to the village of Kalamburi, where another temple was built over it.<note n="5">School Master, Malgund, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Sangameshwar village the Br&#225;hmans also worship the images of the local goddesses Chanduk&#225;i, Jhol&#225;i and Sunk&#225;i. In the Konkan the deities N&#225;r&#225;yan, Rawaln&#225;th, Manli, Datta, Vet&#225;l and Shiva are worshipped <corr sic="every where">everywhere</corr>.<note n="6">School Master, Makhamle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The following legend is told about the deity Vet&#225;l, the leader of the ghosts:&#8212;In the <corr sic="S&#225;wantw&#225;di">S&#225;vantw&#225;di</corr> State there is a temple of Vet&#225;l in the village of Ajgaon.<note n="7">School Master, Sangameshwar, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> As part of his worship it is considered necessary to offer to this deity a pair of shoes every month.

On meeting with a refusal, Parashur&#225;m became enraged and was about to push the sea back with his arrow, when, at the instigation of the sea, a black-bee (<hi>bhunga</hi>) cut the string of his bow, and the arrow only went a short distance.

A goat and some cocks are then sacrificed to the spirits residing in the cemeteries and at the boundary of the village. Cocoanuts besmeared with <hi>gul&#225;l</hi> red powder are also offered to these ghost godlings. A goat decorated with garlands and red powder is then made to walk round the village three times at night, accompanied by the villagers, who throw <hi>l&#225;hya</hi> parched rice while passing. This rite is called <hi>Siwa B&#225;ndhane</hi> or binding the boundary, and is supposed to protect the village crops and cattle. No farmer dares to sow his seed unless this rite has been performed.

Most of the farmers regard one of their dead ancestors as their chief deity, and represent him in their house by a cocoanut. They do not enter on any new business without first offering prayers to this cocoanut, and they also believe that they can bring evil upon their enemies by simply cursing them before the deified cocoanut. The only materials generally required for the worship of this cocoanut are red powder, incense and flowers. On rare occasions, goats and fowls are sacrificed. It is believed that the ancestor in the cocoanut likes to be worshipped by the wife or husband (as the case may be) of the person represented by the cocoanut. Some farmers, in addition to the cocoanut, worship a stick or cap of their ancestor along with the cocoanut, and offer prayers for the protection of their cattle, for good rain and harvest, and also for the destruction of their enemies.<note n="5">School Master, Ag&#225;shi, Th&#225;na District.</note>

The basket is then carried out of the village along with a cock or a goat, and deposited outside the village boundary. To carry this basket, a person belonging to the <corr sic="Mahar">Mah&#225;r</corr> caste is generally selected. The people of the next village similarly carry the basket beyond their village limits; and it is finally thrown into the sea. It is believed that if the basket of offerings to the disease-deities is carried from one village to another, it is sure to bring the disease with it. Great care is therefore taken to throw the offerings into the sea. In cases of small pox a feast is given to women whose husbands are alive. In some cases boiled rice is mixed with the blood of a cock, and on the rice is placed a burning black cotton wick in a cocoanut shell with a little oil in it. The whole is then carried beyond the village boundary and thrown away.<note n="1">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the village of <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr> in the Ratn&#225;giri District, epidemic diseases like cholera, small pox, plague, etc., are supposed to come from disease deities, and in order to avoid the danger of such diseases the people of the village go to the temple of the village deity and pray for protection. The special form of worship on such occasions is the <hi>Kaul</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi>, asking a favour from the deity. When an epidemic of plague broke out for the first time at <corr sic="Sangmeshwar">Sangameshwar</corr>, the people of the village at once proceeded to worship the village deity; but a few cases of plague occurred, even after worshipping the village goddess <hi>J&#225;khm&#225;ta</hi>. When the people went to the temple and asked the reason why the plague continued, it was announced by the deity through the temple ministrant that she was helpless in the case of plague, and desired the people to worship the god Shiva, thereby signifying that the village deity has limited powers, and that the power of averting great evils lies with Shiva the god of destruction.<note n="2">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Devgad Taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District in epidemic diseases like cholera, etc., the usual ceremony, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the <hi>Paradi</hi> (disease-scaring basket) is performed. A basket containing boiled rice, red powder, red flowers, lemons, betel nuts, betel leaves, etc., is prepared, and on that rice is kept a burning cotton wick dipped in oil. The basket is then carried beyond the village boundary along with a goat having a red flower garland round its neck. The goat is set free at the outskirts of the village. In cases of small pox, married women whose husbands are alive are worshipped with turmeric powder, cocoanuts, flowers, etc., and incense is kept burning in the house. The deity of small pox is also specially worshipped for a number of days. It is represented by a brass or copper <hi>lota</hi> with a cocoanut placed over it. This process is called <hi>m&#225;nd bharane</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> arranging the materials of worship. The girls in the house sing songs in praise of the small pox deity.

There are no other deities who cause such diseases.<note n="2">School Master, Achare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Vijayadurg in the Ratn&#225;giri District, in cases of small pox, the child suffering from the disease is made to sleep on a silk garment <hi>Sovalen</hi>. Flowers are thrown upon the patient&#8217;s body, and are given to him to smell. Incense is burnt in the house. On the seventh day from the beginning of the disease, the child is first bathed in milk and then in water. Black scented powder called <hi>Abir</hi> is thrown on the body. After two or three days an image representing the deity is made of flour, which is worshipped, and a feast is given to Br&#225;hmans and unwidowed women.<note n="3">School Master, Vijaydurg, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Basani in the Ratn&#225;giri District the disease of small pox is averted by a Br&#225;hman worshipping the goddess <hi>Shitala</hi>.

The <hi>mantras</hi> of the goddess and the Shitala <hi>Ashtaka</hi> are also repeated in the <hi>Paur&#225;nic</hi> style. The women walk round the temple every day as long as the signs of the disease are visible on their children. The goddess is worshipped with turmeric and red powders, and clothes and fruits are given to her. The <hi>Kaul</hi> ceremony is also practised in this District. It is worth noticing that even Musalm&#225;ns ask for a <hi>Kaul</hi> from this goddess. The days fixed for <hi>Kaul</hi> are:&#8212;Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. The morning hours are considered specially auspicious <pb id="pb31" n="31"/>for the <hi>Kaul</hi>. There is another temple at Chaul, of the goddess Shri Gol&#225;ba <hi>Devi</hi>. This goddess is also worshipped when other epidemic diseases prevail in the village. <hi>Sapt&#225;ha</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> continuous worship for seven days is also performed in honour of the deity.

</p><p>In the village of Anjur in the Th&#225;na District, in cases of long standing fevers the Br&#225;hmans observe the ceremony called <hi>Udak Shanti</hi> or propitiation by water. It is as follows:&#8212;An earthen pot filled with water is placed on the ground. On the top of the pot is placed a round plate in which the image of the god Brahmadev the son of Vishnu is consecrated. Four Br&#225;hmans sit on the four sides of the pot and repeat their Vedic hymns. These four Br&#225;hmans are supposed to be the four mouths of the god Brahmadev.

The people assembled at the spot partake of the food. To avert fever, the people perform a certain ceremony ordained in the <hi>Sh&#225;stras</hi>. If the sick person is supposed to be under the evil influence of the planet Saturn, the planet is invoked by repeating the <pb id="pb32" n="32"/><hi>mantras</hi>, and worshipped with the usual offerings. Garments such as a <hi>S&#225;ri</hi> and a <hi>Choli</hi> are offered to the goddesses M&#225;ri and K&#225;lub&#225;i.

Persons well versed in the <hi>mantras</hi> of evil spirits are called Bhagats or exorcists. Some of them keep evil spirits at their command. The poor people believe that what these exorcists foretell is sure to occur. It is believed that the spirit dwells on the tongue of these exorcists. When these spirits are hungry, they are let loose in the village by the sorcerers for the destruction of the people, thus causing an epidemic. When a spirit is to be destroyed, the people of the village assemble in a mob and attack the sorcerer, a small quantity of blood is taken from his tongue and water from the earthen pot of a Ch&#225;mbh&#225;r is poured upon it. It is believed that by so doing the spirit is permanently destroyed and the sorcerer either forgets all his <hi>mantras</hi> or they become ineffective.

He also cries out loudly.

He also stands and sways his body to and fro for some time, then assumes a serene and quiet attitude, and begins to cry out loudly.<note n="12">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> There are some sorcerers at D&#225;sgaon in the Kol&#225;ba District, who dance and cry out loudly in order to drive out the evil spirits from the body of the diseased.<note n="13">Schoolmaster, D&#225;sgaon, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At M&#225;l&#225;d in the Th&#225;na District dancing is used <pb id="pb35" n="35"/>in exorcism. The following is a description of one of these dances. Songs of the deity which is to be summoned on the occasion are sung along with the music of the <hi>T&#225;l</hi> (a kind of cymbal) and the beating of drums called <hi>Ghumat</hi>. The <hi>Ghumat</hi> is an earthen jar, the lower and upper ends of which are covered over with leather. The man in whose body the deity is to make its appearance takes his bath and sits by the side of a small prayer carpet called <hi>Asan</hi>. A small quantity of rice (about a <hi>ser</hi>) is put in front of the carpet, and a copper pot filled with water is placed on the rice. The musicians begin to strike their instrument with a loud clash, and the exorcist&#8217;s body begins to shake. The shaking of the body is a sure indication of his being spirit-possessed. He then sits upon the carpet and begins to throw grains of rice into the <corr sic="coppe">copper</corr> pot containing water, gives out the name of the particular spirit with which he is possessed, and the cause for which it has attacked the patient. He then explains the measures and rites by which the spirit can be driven out. The people abide by his directions, and the patient is thus cured.<note n="1">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Padghe in the Th&#225;na District, when an evil spirit is to be driven out from the body of the patient, the latter is asked to hold in his mouth a betelnut or a lemon. After some time, the betelnut or the lemon is put into a bottle, the bottle is then tightly corked and buried underground. A copper pot is filled with water, and the diseased person is asked to hold the pot upside down. If the water runs out it is believed that the spirit has disappeared.<note n="2">School Master, Padghe, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>In the village of Edwan of the Th&#225;na District, dancing is practised in cases of spirit possession, but it is resorted to among the lower castes only. While dancing, the sorcerer cries out loudly, and throws grains of <hi>Udid</hi> (<corr sic="Phasee olus">Phaseolus</corr> radiatus) on the body of the diseased person<note n="3">School Master, Edwan, Th&#225;na.</note> after repeating certain <hi>mantras</hi>.

</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, dancing is not used in exorcism, but the people suffering from evil spirits sometimes dance and cry out loudly. Some of them loose their hair while dancing, and even strike their heads. Some quarrel like combatants, and some of them try to make speeches like orators. There is a temple of the god Shri Dutta at Narsinhw&#225;di in the Kolh&#225;pur State, to which people suffering from evil spirits are brought for a cure. These people cry out loudly when the palanquin of the <hi>Sw&#225;mi <corr sic="Maharaj">Mah&#225;r&#225;j</corr></hi> is carried through the village, and spirits usually quit the bodies of their victims at this <corr sic="ime">time</corr>, for it is said that they cannot bear the proximity of the <hi>Sw&#225;mi Mah&#225;r&#225;j</hi>. Patients are also cured by residing in the village for a certain period. On this account the village of Narsob&#225;chiw&#225;di is considered very holy. A big festival is celebrated in this village annually on the twelfth day of the dark half of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October).

His appointment is hereditary, the clever member of the family generally following the profession of his father.<note n="5">School Master, Sangameshwar, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In the Devgad taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District, low class people are afraid of sorcerers because they might injure them if they are offended. They therefore are careful not to cause them displeasure. There, the profession of a sorcerer or exorcist is not hereditary.

</p><p>In the Vengurla taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District, the chief function of the village sorcerer is to find remedies for the cure of persons suffering from evil spirits.

</p><p>At Chidhran in the Panwel taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District, Bhutes, a caste of beggars, are the devotees of a goddess. Some of them are called <hi>Bhagats</hi>. <hi>Devrishis</hi> are very rare. The difference between a <hi>Devrishi</hi> and a <hi>Bhagat</hi> is as follows:&#8212;A <hi>Devrishi</hi> removes the evil spirits by simply repeating the <hi>mantras</hi> while the <hi>Bhagat</hi> removes them by bringing the evil spirit into his own body and by dancing, etc.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Chidran">Chidhran</corr>, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District, Bhutes go begging in the morning every day for the first nine days of the month of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October). On the tenth day the Bhutya is given a pice from every house. These Bhutes are devotees of the goddess Shakti. At Sasawane in the Kol&#225;ba District the village sorcerer comes to beg every day and is given rice, etc., but during the first nine days of the bright half of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October) he is given copper coins.<note n="5">School Master, Sasawane, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At Anjur in the Th&#225;na District the devotee of a particular god is called <hi>Bhagat</hi>, and one who knows how to summon or eject evil spirits is called Bhutya. A Devrishi is a person who knows the <hi>mantras</hi> for warding off the great evil spirits such as <hi>Brahma R&#225;kshasa</hi>, <hi>Brahma Samband</hi>, etc. These three classes are respected only for performing their respective duties, and not otherwise.<note n="6">School Master, Anjur, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, the sorcerer is never appointed. His functions are to ask a <hi>kaul</hi> from the deity, to pray for the welfare of the people, and explain to them what he sees in his dreams. He holds no position in higher society, but the poor people who believe in him are afraid of him. Sorcerers are generally very cunning; they frighten poor people, and obtain from them presents and gifts for their maintenance.<note n="7">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>

The custom prevails of the worship of a well by women after their delivery. A woman, after completing the period of her confinement or ceremonial impurity, is taken to a well, from which she has to bring home water, and is required to worship the well with the following materials, <hi>viz<corr>.</corr></hi>:&#8212;cotton thread, copper coins, cocoanuts and such other fruit as can be had on the occasion.<note n="3">School Master, Vavanje, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At Varsai in the Pen taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District, offerings of cotton cloth, copper coins, cocoanuts, betelnuts and plantains are made to the Banyan, <hi>Pipal</hi>, and <hi>Umbar</hi> trees, and also to holy wells.

Some persons hold a thread ceremony for the Pipal tree in order to obtain a son, and worship the tree for a certain period. It is worshipped with fruit and copper coins. Wooden cradles are also offered to the tree.

It is as follows:&#8212;A woman without a child cuts secretly a little piece from the garment of a woman who has children. She then burns the piece, puts the ashes into water, and the mixture is then drunk by the barren woman. It is believed that, by so doing, the evil spirit of the disease that is troubling the barren woman is transferred to the other who has children. The barrenness of the first woman then disappears, and she begets children. It is said that if the second woman comes to know of the mischief before using that garment, she discontinues the use of the same, and no harm is done to her.<note n="3">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d, Th&#225;na.</note>

<pb id="pb40" n="40"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch4" n="IV" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER IV.</head><head><hi>WORSHIP OF ANCESTORS AND SAINTS.</hi></head><p>In the Konkan, especially among the lower classes, a strong belief prevails regarding the mortality of the spirits of the dead and of their re-appearance or re-birth in their children. And for this reason, as well as for protection against evil, the dead ancestors are worshipped.
</p><p>The custom regarding the worship of ancestors prevailing at K&#225;lshe in the Ratn&#225;giri District is as follows:&#8212;The worship of ancestors is called <hi>Shr&#225;ddha</hi> (anniversary). It is performed on the no moon day of every month, on the date of the death of the person every year, and also on the same date of the dark half of the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> (September). Among the Br&#225;hmans, Br&#225;hman priests are invited, worshipped, and are given a feast, after worshipping balls of boiled rice as representing the dead ancestors. The special materials used for worship are sesamum and barley grain. The same custom prevails among non-Br&#225;hmans with the exception that the balls are made of rice flour and not of boiled rice. To partake of the food on such occasions, the lower classes invite married persons of their own caste. The anniversary day of <hi>S&#225;dhus</hi> and <hi>Mahants</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi><corr>,</corr> saints, is called <hi>Punya tithi</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi><corr>,</corr> the day of merit.
</p><p>It is commonly believed that spirits are mortal. The life of the deceased remains in the spirit condition until the sins which he may have committed are washed away by the good deeds of his descendants. There is no belief that one spirit dies and another takes its place, but it is believed that the ancestors are sometimes reborn in the same family.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="K&#225;lse">K&#225;lshe</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda in the Vengurla taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District ancestors are worshipped every year on the same date of the month (according to the Hindu calendar year) on which the person died, by performing a <hi>Shr&#225;ddha</hi> rite. They are also worshipped on the same date in the second half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> (September) every year. This is by a rite called <hi>Mah&#225;laya Shr&#225;ddha</hi>. On both these occasions Br&#225;hmans are invited, and the worshipping ceremony is performed by repeating the <hi>mantras</hi>. After the ceremony, all the invited guests men and women partake of food.
</p><p>S&#225;dhus are worshipped after washing their feet with sandal paste, flowers, cocoanuts and gifts of money.
</p><p>It is believed that evil spirits undergo a transformation after a lapse of twelve years. The practice of giving the names of ancestors to children is common, and it is due to the belief that the spirits of the dead are reborn in children in the same family.<note n="2">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Pendur in the Ratn&#225;giri District the ancestors are worshipped on the last day of every Hindu calendar month. This monthly worship is called <hi>Darsha Shr&#225;ddha</hi>. The annual <corr sic="anniversay">anniversary</corr> of the <hi>manes</hi> is celebrated by the ceremony called the <hi>S&#225;mvatsarik Shr&#225;ddha</hi>. If any ancestor has died after becoming a recluse or <hi>Sany&#225;si</hi>, his body is <pb id="pb41" n="41"/>buried, and a tomb called a <hi>sam&#225;dhi</hi> is erected over it; and his descendants, instead of performing the annual <hi>Shr&#225;ddha</hi>, worship the tomb of the recluse every day. It is believed that the spirits take a different form after the lapse of seven generations. The belief that the spirits of the dead are reborn in the same family prevails among the people of this district. The following measures are adopted for the purpose of identification. When a person dies in a family, a basil or <hi>bel</hi> leaf is placed on a certain part of the body, or some familiar sign is made in sandal paste; and when a child is born in the family, its body is carefully examined to ascertain whether there are any signs on the body of the child such as were made on the dead body of the ancestor. If the same sign appears to the satisfaction of the members of the family, it is believed that the dead person has been reborn in the same family.<note n="1">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Navare in the Ratn&#225;giri District Br&#225;hmans are invited, worshipped and given a feast in honour of ancestors. <hi>S&#225;dhus</hi> and <hi>Mahants</hi>, or saints, are worshipped by giving them the same honour accorded to the family deities.<note n="2">School Master, Navare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Basani in the Ratn&#225;giri District the anniversary day of saints is observed by the performance of a <hi>Bhajan</hi>, which consists in singing the good deeds of saints and in offering prayers. It is believed that spirits are mortal, but they do not die like ordinary human beings. They cease to exist as spirits as soon as the period of their release is over. The spirits obtain absolution by visiting certain holy places.<note n="3">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Dabhol in the Ratn&#225;giri District the people believe that the souls of ancestors are reborn in children in the same family if some of their desires remain unfulfilled at the time of their demise.<note n="4">School Master, Dabhol, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Shiravde in the Ratn&#225;giri District ancestors are worshipped every year by performing the rites called <hi>tarpan</hi>, which consist in offering oblations of holy water, sesamum, barley grains and repeating prayers. The <hi>tarpan</hi> is observed on the very date of the month in which the person died. The procedure of worshipping the Hindu saints is similar to that of the other deities. Owing to the belief that the <corr sic="spirit">spirits</corr> of the dead are reborn in children in the same family the name of the grandfather is given to the grandson.<note n="5">School Master, Shiravde, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At N&#225;ringre in the Ratn&#225;giri taluka ancestors are worshipped by inviting Br&#225;hman priests, and worshipping them with sandal paste and flowers.

This <hi>Shr&#225;ddha</hi> is called <hi>Duhitra</hi>. A person who has lost his wife has to perform the <hi>Shr&#225;ddha</hi> for that wife on the 9th day of the dark half of the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi>. This day is called <hi>Ahev Navami</hi>. These different sorts of <hi>Shr&#225;ddhas</hi> are observed only by the high class Hindus. The lower classes worship their ancestors on the last day of the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> by preparing a ball of boiled rice or flour, and putting it out for the crows to eat. It is believed that spirits are mortal. The ceremony called <hi>Narayan Nagabali</hi> is performed when it is believed that the spirit of an ancestor is giving trouble to the family. When this rite is performed, the spirit is saved and the ailment ceases. It is believed that the spirits of the dead are sometimes reborn in children in the same family, and in such cases the names of the ancestors are given to their children by the people.<note n="5">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Khopoli in the Karjat taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District the form of worship of ancestors is similar to that of the ordinary Hindu deities.

</p><p>The people of Chidhran in the Kol&#225;ba District believe that the period for which the soul has to remain in the spirit state depends <pb id="pb43" n="43"/>upon the sins of the person, or the wishes which remained unfulfilled during his life time. It is not that all the spirits of the dead are reborn in children. The rebirth depends upon the good or bad deeds of the deceased. However, if the nature of any child suggests the nature of any dead person in the family, it is assumed that the spirit of the deceased has returned to the family.<note n="1">School Master, Chidhran, Kol&#225;ba.</note>

The custom of giving a grandfather&#8217;s name to the grandson prevails largely, and is due to the belief that the spirits of the dead are sometimes reborn in the same family.<note n="2">School Master, N&#225;gothane, Kol&#225;ba.</note> It is also said that in some of the Hindu communities, if a child cries continuously, ashes are applied to its forehead in the name of one of the ancestors in the family; and if the child sleeps quietly or stops crying, the name of that ancestor is given to it.<note n="3">School Master, Vavanje, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Shirgaon in the Th&#225;na District, the worship of ancestors is performed on the day of the father&#8217;s death, every year. On any auspicious occasion the rite called <hi>Nandi shr&#225;ddha</hi> is performed at the beginning of the ceremony. It is believed that evil spirits or ghosts have to remain in the ghostly state for about one thousand years, or at least until one of the descendants in the family goes to a holy place like <hi>K&#225;shi</hi> (Benares) and there performs the <hi>shr&#225;ddha</hi> rites of his ancestors.<note n="4">School Master, Shirgaon, Th&#225;na.</note>

A man suffering from fits showed an inclination to go to Kawad to read <hi>Guru Charitra</hi> for seven successive days. He was taken to that place accordingly. After his arrival, he continued to suffer from these fits in the morning and evening at the time of the worship at the tomb. Once during the fits he said that he would be free from the disease if Rs. 200 were spent in giving a feast to the Br&#225;hmans at P&#225;li.

He came to his senses after ten minutes, and from that time he was completely cured. A feast was then given to the Br&#225;hmans at P&#225;li, and Rs. 200 were spent over it as promised. Another instance of miracular power is cited, and that is of the priest of the goddess <hi>Mahaluxmi</hi> of Kolwan.

These <hi>Sam&#225;dhis</hi> are of two kinds: (1) of saints after death, and (2) of saints on the point of death.

The present disciple of Bhujanga Sw&#225;mi sits in (<hi>Sam&#225;dhi</hi>) meditation continuously for four to eight days. There prevails a belief at Kolh&#225;pur that the <hi>sw&#225;mi</hi> whose body is buried in the tomb at Chinchwad is still alive. Some years ago when the present disciple of the Chinchwad <hi>Sw&#225;mi</hi> was anxious to take <hi>Sam&#225;dh</hi>, he had a dream in which the <hi>sw&#225;mi</hi> in the tomb told him that he was still living in that <hi>Sam&#225;dhi</hi>, and that therefore there was no need for his disciple to take <hi>Sam&#225;dh</hi>. He was thus obliged to forego the project. The Peshwas of Poona, who were staunch devotees of the Chinchwad <hi>sw&#225;mi</hi>, and by whose favour they were raised to a position of social equality among the Deccan Br&#225;hmans, granted an <hi>Inam</hi> of some villages for the maintenance of this <hi>Sam&#225;dhi</hi>, and the British Government have allowed the descendants of the <hi>sw&#225;mi</hi> to retain the <hi>Inam</hi>. The following are the principal Musalman saints who have been deified in the Kolhapur District:&#8212;
</p><p>(1) <hi>B&#225;ba Jam&#225;l</hi>, (2) <hi>Ghod Pir</hi>, (3) <hi>Bara Im&#225;m</hi>, (4) <hi>Avachit Pir</hi>, (5) <hi>Buran S&#225;heb</hi> and (5) <hi>Mira S&#225;heb</hi> of <hi>Miraj</hi>.

</p><p>At Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda in the Vengurla taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District some Hindus have adopted the worship of Mahomedan saints. Mahomedan Pirs are worshipped in the month of <hi>Moharram</hi>. On these occasions Hindus beg in the town in the disguise of <hi>Fakirs</hi>, and the alms thus obtained are offered to the Pir. They make offerings of water to the Pirs, while the <hi>t&#225;buts</hi> are being carried to the sea for immersion. But this practice is being slowly discontinued.<note n="3">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At B&#225;ndivade in the Ratn&#225;giri District Hindus offer cocoanuts and <hi>khichadi</hi> to the Pirs at the time of the <hi>Moharram</hi>, and at some places a lamp is kept burning every Monday in honour of a Pir.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Bandivade">B&#225;ndivade</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

</p><p>At Ade in the D&#225;poli taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District there is a tomb of a Musalman saint which is worshipped by the Hindus including the Br&#225;hmans. The building and also the mosque in that village have been repaired from contributions obtained from high class Hindus.<note n="6">School Master, Murud, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Many Hindus of Devagad in the Ratn&#225;giri District worship Musalman saints.

The Br&#225;hman worshipper performs this task more for the pecuniary benefit which he derives from the worship than from faith in the divinity of the Pir.<note n="3">School Master, Chidhran, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Poladpur in the Mah&#225;d taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District there are no instances of Musalm&#225;n saints being worshipped by Hindus, but persons wishing to have children make vows to Pirs, and children born by the favour of such Pirs are required to assume the robe of a <hi>Fakir</hi> during the <hi>Moharram</hi> festivities.<note n="4">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>The practice of worshipping such saints exists at Khopoli in the Kol&#225;ba District.

</p><p>The Hindus of Bhuwan in the Murb&#225;d taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District worship the Pir of the locality.

</p><p>Many Hindus in the Ratn&#225;giri District believe that the soul goes to drink water at night, and therefore keep a pot filled with water at their sleeping place.<note n="10">School Master, <corr sic="Kalshe">K&#225;lshe</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The people of Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District do not consider it possible ordinarily for the soul to leave the body, but they state that the Sw&#225;mi of Alandi, who died in or about the year 1886, used to remove his soul from the body by means of <hi>Yoga</hi>.<note n="11">School Master, Chaul, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, it is believed that the soul leaves the body temporarily at night when a person is asleep.<note n="12">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke.</note>
<pb id="pb51" n="51"/></p><p>At Bankavali in the D&#225;poli taluka, it is believed that ghosts or evil spirits have the form of a human being, but their feet are turned backwards. They can assume any form they choose. Their character is ordinarily to trouble the people, but when satisfied they are said to prove friendly. The following story is narrated of a person who went to reside in one of the villages of the Konkan. His wife was first attacked by a ghost called Girha. The Girha troubled him much by playing mischief in his house, <hi>viz<corr>.</corr></hi>: by taking away eatables or by mixing dirt in his food. At night he used to divest the couple of their clothes, and on one occasion an ornament was removed by the spirit from the person of the wife. Tired of these annoyances, the man left the village and went to reside at a distance, when, to the astonishment of the public, it happened that the ornament which was lost at the old village was restored to the man&#8217;s wife while she was asleep in the new village, and nobody knew who brought it there. All this was believed to be the work of the Girha.<note n="1">School Master, Bankavali, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda in the Vengurla taluka people believe that a <hi>Bhut</hi> is fierce in aspect and very troublesome, but when its wishes are complied with, it becomes harmless. The <hi>Bhuts</hi> reside in jungles, burial or cremation grounds, old trees, sacred groves and deserted houses. They assume all sorts of shapes and forms. Sometimes they appear very tall, and they can instantly assume the shape of a dog, a cat, a tiger, or any other animal. Some ghosts are even seen fishing on the banks of rivers.<note n="2">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr> in the Devgad taluka it is believed that the souls of those who die with their wishes unfulfilled take the form of a <hi>Bhut</hi>. They enter the bodies of people. Any woman who is attacked by the <hi>Bhut</hi> of a Pir becomes able to speak in the Hindi language although it may not be her mother tongue. When a child or a person is suffering from the attacks of a spirit, incense is burnt, and it at once begins to tell the whereabouts of the spirit and the reason why the person has been attacked. He is then asked to state what he wants, and when the things which the spirit wants are offered, it goes away.<note n="3">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Spirits are generally invisible.
</p><p>The spirits that belong to the class of malignant <hi>Bhuts</hi> are of a ferocious appearance; but those that belong to the class of friendly <hi>Bhuts</hi> possess bodies like human beings.<note n="4">School Master <corr sic="Ibhrampur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At N&#225;ringre in the Devgad taluka, it is believed that spirits are cruel by nature and have no shadow, that they are capable of taking any form they like, and can perform miracles.<note n="5">School Master, N&#225;ringre, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Pendur it is believed that <hi>Bhuts</hi> eat chillies, and that they do not speak with human beings. Spirits are said to remove and conceal their victims for a certain period of time.<note n="6">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Vijayadurg, a <hi>Bhut</hi> is considered to be of mean character. People perform certain rites to bring it under subjection. Their actions are always contrary to nature. When a person begins to cry, dance, to eat forbidden things etc. he is said to be attacked by a <hi>Bhut</hi>. When there is enmity between two persons, the one who dies first becomes a <hi>sambandh</hi> and troubles his living enemy.<note n="7">School Master, Vijayadurg, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Basani, there is a belief that there are two kinds of spirits. Some aim at the welfare of the people, and others are always troublesome. As they have no regular form they cannot easily be recognised. They can change their forms at any time.<note n="8">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The character of a <hi>Bhut</hi> is to trouble people and to take revenge on an old enemy. A person attacked by a spirit speaks incoherently and acts like a mad man. In such cases the leaves of the herb <hi>sat&#225;p</hi> are used. <pb id="pb52" n="52"/>The leaves are pounded and put under the patient&#8217;s nose. In a few minutes, the person who is possessed by the spirit begins to speak.<note n="1">School Master, Chawl, Kol&#225;ba,</note>
</p><p>The people of Chauk in the Kol&#225;ba District believe that the main function of a <hi>Bhut</hi> is to frighten people, to beat them, and to make them perform unpleasant tasks and thereby to obtain food from them.<note n="2">School Master, Chauk, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At Pol&#225;dpur it is believed that if a person is able to bring a <hi>Bhut</hi> under his control he can make it do every kind of work for himself.<note n="3">School Master, Pol&#225;dpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The people of Akshi believe that kindling fire without any reason and throwing stones at certain houses are the main functions of <hi>Bhuts</hi>.<note n="4">School Master, Akshi, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At V&#225;vashi in the Pen <corr sic="t&#225;luka">taluka</corr>, it is believed that <hi>Bhuts</hi>, while walking, never touch the earth but always move through the air, and that they have no shadow.<note n="5">School Master, V&#225;vashi, Kol&#225;ba.</note> The old men of Shirgaum in the M&#225;him taluka advise young children not to respond to the call of anybody at night unless the person calling is an acquaintance. For such calls are sometimes those of an evil spirit.<note n="6">School Master, Shirgaum, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>In the Kolh&#225;pur District, it is believed that the character of a <hi>Bhut</hi> is like that of a human being. When a person is attacked by a spirit, a great change is observed in his language and actions. He begins to speak in the language of the <hi>Bhut</hi> by which he is attacked. If the ghost is of the female sex, the person speaks the language of females. It is believed that the souls of those who have been murdered or tortured assume the form of a spirit known as <hi>Sambandh</hi>, and trouble the murderer or the torturer, by entering his body. It is said that in some cases the spirit does not leave the body of such a person till he dies, thus exacting revenge for his past misdeeds.<note n="7">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note> In Khopoli in Ratn&#225;giri it is said that the cow which is given to a Br&#225;hman while performing the funeral rites of a dead person helps him to reach heaven. He gets there by catching hold of her tail. There are three paths to the other world. They are <hi>Bhaktim&#225;rga</hi>, <hi>Karmam&#225;rga</hi>, and <hi>Yogam&#225;rga</hi>. The <hi>Karmam&#225;rga</hi> is believed to be superior to all.<note n="8">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note> At M&#225;l&#225;d, a belief prevails that the path to the other world is through the Him&#225;layas. While going through the mountains of the Him&#225;layas, souls find happiness or sorrow according to their actions in life-time. The people also believe that the soul returns every month on the date of the man&#8217;s death to accept <hi>K&#225;gv&#225;s</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi><corr>,</corr> cooked food given to the <hi>manes</hi>, and reaches heaven at the end of one year.<note n="9">School Master, M&#225;l&#225;d, Th&#225;na.</note> At <corr sic="Dahigaum">Dahigaon</corr> in the Murb&#225;d taluka, it is customary among the Hindus to smear with cow dung the place from which a dead body has been removed to the burning ground. The place is then covered with rice flour, and is hidden under a basket, an oil-lamp being kept, burning near by. The persons who accompany the corpse return home to look at the lamp, and it is believed that the soul of the deceased will pass to any creature or species of which footprints are seen on the rice flour.<note n="10">School Master, Dahigaon, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur it is believed that the soul of a person after death attains that state to which he aspires at the last moment before his death. Virtuous persons who die without any desire reach heaven and remain there in the form of the stars, where they are believed to enjoy the happiness of heaven. Some of them are sent to this world when they wish to return. Sinners are said to reach hell in consequence of their misdeeds, but some remain in this world in the form of <hi>Bhuts</hi>.<note n="11">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
<pb id="pb53" n="53"/></p><p>The people of Achare in the M&#225;lwan taluka believe that the souls of persons who die by accident return to the same caste, and have to remain there till the expiry of an appointed period.<note n="1">School Master, Achare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The people of Chauk believe that persons dying a sudden or violent death leave wishes unfulfilled, and are therefore compelled to remain in this world in the form of <hi>Bhuts</hi>.<note n="2">School Master, Chauk, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At R&#225;i in the S&#225;lsette taluka it is believed that the souls of those dying a sudden or violent death attain salvation according to their deeds in lifetime, but it is a current belief that those committing suicide take the form of a ghost, and those who die on battlefields attain eternal salvation.<note n="3">School Master, R&#225;i, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, it is believed that the souls of those who die violent deaths do not attain salvation, but are turned into ghosts.<note n="4">R&#225;o <corr sic="Saheb">S&#225;heb</corr> Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>The people of Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda in the Vengurla taluka believe that <hi>Bhuts</hi> do not possess visible human forms. They can assume any shapes they like, but there is a common belief that the hands and feet of <hi>Bhuts</hi> are always turned backwards.<note n="5">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The most favourable times for spirits to enter human bodies are midday, midnight and twilight.<note n="6">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Women in delivery as well as those in their menses are most liable to be attacked by spirits.<note n="7">School Master, <corr sic="Rai">R&#225;i</corr>, Th&#225;na.</note> It is generally believed that persons adorned with ornaments are attacked by spirits, especially in cases of women and children. Again, a common belief prevails in the Konkan that persons, and particularly ladies, decked with flowers and ornaments are more liable to be attacked by spirits than others.<note n="8">School Master, B&#225;ndivade, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The people of Fonda are of opinion that spirits generally enter and leave human bodies through the organ of hearing, while the people of N&#225;ringre hold that the hair is the best way for spirits to enter.<note n="9">School Master, <corr sic="Fonde">Fonda</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The residents of <corr sic="Ibhr&#225;mpur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr> state that the mouth and the nose are the favourite channels for spirits entering human bodies.<note n="10">School Master, <corr sic="Ibhr&#225;mpur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr> it is believed that spirits attack people in the throat, and generally only those persons who are uncleanly in their habits are liable to be attacked. There are no special ways for entering human bodies.<note n="11">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At Chaul a belief prevails that spirits enter the body when a person is suffering from any disease or when he is frightened.<note n="12">School Master, Chawl, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Konkan, people attempt to find good or bad omens in sneezing. It depends upon the time and the position or standing of the person who sneezes. If a sick person sneezes it is presumed that he will recover from his illness within a very short period, but if the sneezing is caused by the use of tobacco or snuff, no good or bad omens are drawn.<note n="13">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Sneezing at the time of conversation or when contemplating any particular task or business is held to be inauspicious. Hence if anybody sneezes at the beginning of a task, or at the time of starting out on any such task, the time is unfavourable. Yawning is said to be caused by a relative or friend remembering the person who yawns.<note n="14">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> In ancient times happiness and calamities were foretold by a voice from the sky, and in modern days they are expressed by sneezing. People have much faith in sneezing, and often inquire whether it is a good or bad omen to sneeze at the beginning of any work or undertaking.<note n="15">School Master, B&#225;ndivade, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>If a man sneezes with his face towards the west, it is considered auspicious. If a man sneezes while contemplating any task or business, the sneezing is considered inauspicious. <pb id="pb54" n="54"/>Sneezing at the time of taking food <hi>i.e.</hi> while at meals, while sleeping, and while sitting on a praying carpet is considered auspicious. Sneezing with one&#8217;s face turned towards the north, the south, and the east is also unlucky.<note n="1">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the case of Bhagats and exorcists yawning is considered to indicate that the disease will disappear.<note n="2">School Master, Chawl, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Konkan it is believed that sneezing and yawning indicate the call of death, and therefore it is customary among the Hindus to snap the thumb and the middle finger at the time of yawning, and to repeat the words <hi>Shatanjiva</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> Live for hundred years, at the time of sneezing.<note n="3">School Master, Vavanje, Kol&#225;ba.</note> Sneezing on a threshold is believed to forebode evil.<note n="4">School Master, Umbergaon, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, people believe that sneezing and yawning forebode evil, and the practice is to repeat the following words at the time of sneezing and yawning, viz, <hi>Shatanjiva</hi> <hi>i.e.</hi> Live a hundred years, and also to repeat the name of <hi>R&#225;m</hi>, while snapping the thumb and finger (<hi>chutaki</hi>). In the case of a person suffering from a serious illness, sneezing is supposed to indicate a cure. If a woman sneezes while a man speaks, it is lucky, and if a man sneezes it is unlucky. The reverse is the case in respect of females.<note n="5"><corr sic="R&#224;o">R&#225;o</corr> <corr sic="Saheb">S&#225;heb</corr> Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>In the Konkan, R&#225;kshasas, or malevolent spirits, are believed to be very cruel. These evil spirits are held in great fear, and people try to avoid giving them offence. It is supposed that to cause displeasure to these demons may bring about death. With a view to propitiate them, offerings of cocks and goats are made to them every year regularly on fixed days.<note n="6">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> If a woman gives birth to a child which is extraordinary or horrible in size and appearance, it is believed to be a demon reborn. Such a child is supposed to bring bad luck to the family.<note n="7">School Master, <corr sic="Fonde">Fonda</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The Konkan people believe that in former days R&#225;kshasas, or malevolent demons, used to be tall, ugly, black, with long and loose hair, big teeth, and with their foreheads painted with red lead, or <hi>shendur</hi>. They could assume any form they liked, were powerful, and could fly in the air. They were fond of human flesh.<note n="8">School Master, Adivan, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The people of Khopoli believe that Khavis is the ghost of an African <hi>Sidhi</hi>. This spirit is very malevolent, and exorcists find it very difficult to bring it under control. A strong belief prevails in the Konkan districts that those attacked by the spirits of non-Hindus are beyond cure.<note n="9">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>According to the belief of the people in the Kolh&#225;pur District, <hi>Brahma R&#225;kshasa</hi> is one of the most powerful spirits.

It often troubles people while crossing rivers or creeks at night, and leads them to places where the water is very deep. It is said that the spirit Girha becomes the regular slave of a person who takes possession of the hair of its head, and gives him anything that he requires. It requests the person to return its hair, but this should not be given under any circumstances. For, if the Girha gets back its hair all sorts of misfortunes will befall the man.<note n="11">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

Alwant is believed to be the spirit of a woman dying at childbirth or during her menses. <pb id="pb56" n="56"/>It resides at burial or cremation grounds.

</p><p>The special precautions that a father has to take at the birth of a child are:&#8212;
</p><p>To arrange for a suitable place or a room provided with the materials required for the occasion, and to ensure the correct moment for the birth of the child. No person other than a midwife is allowed to enter the room for the first ten days. A pot is kept filled with water and a twig of the <hi>nim</hi> tree in the entrance of the house, and all persons entering the house have to wash their feet with this water.
</p><p>A knife or some other sharp weapon is kept under the bed of the woman in order that the mother and her child may not be attacked by a spirit.<note n="5">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>The chief reason for ensuring the correct moment for the birth is that, if the birth takes place at an unlucky hour, special rites are necessary for averting the evil effects. These rites consist in the recitation of certain holy <hi>mantras</hi> and in giving presents of money, sessamum, <hi>j&#225;gri</hi>, clarified butter, etc., to the Br&#225;hmans and alms to the poor.<note n="6">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

</p><p>An owl is considered to be a bird of such evil repute that, in all parts of the Konkan, it is considered necessary to perform expiatory rites when an owl perches on the roof.

</p><p>At Chauk an owl is said to have some connection with spirits. Its sound at night indicates the approaching death of a sick person in the house.

<pb id="pb59" n="59"/></p><p>At Umbergaon people do not throw stones at an owl. For it is considered that the owl might sit and rub the stone, and that the person throwing it will become weak and wasted as the stone wears away.<note n="1">School Master, Umbergaon, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The people of Kolh&#225;pur do not believe that there is any connection between the bat or owl and the spirits of the dead, but they believe that, if an owl cries out in the evening or at night, it indicates the death of a sick person in the family.

</p><p>It is generally believed that old unoccupied houses are haunted by evil spirits. Persons who wish to inhabit such houses first perform the <hi>V&#225;stu sh&#225;nti</hi> ceremony, and give a feast to Br&#225;hmans. In former times, in the districts that were ruled by the Portuguese, religious persecution prevailed. To escape from these persecutions, people were compelled to leave their houses unprotected. Before leaving their houses, they used to bury their treasure in the ground, and on that spot a human being or an animal was sacrificed in order that the spirit of the dead should hover about the place, and prevent strangers from coming.<note n="3">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

</p><p>At Vijayadurg it is believed that a person who builds a house in the days of his prosperity and does not survive to enjoy it, becomes a <hi>Sambandh</hi>. He remains in that house in the form of a ghost, and troubles every one who comes to stay there, excepting the members of his family. A man who buries his treasure underground becomes a ghost after death, comes back to watch his treasure, and troubles those who try to remove it.<note n="6">School Master, <corr sic="Vijayadrug">Vijayadurg</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Unoccupied houses are generally haunted by evil spirits. At certain forts in the Konkan where battles were fought, the souls of those slain in the battles are said to have assumed the forms of spirits, and to keep a watch over the forts.<note n="7">School Master, Pol&#225;dpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Kolh&#225;pur District there is a village Nigve beyond the river Panch Ganga at a distance of three miles from Kolh&#225;pur, where the soul of a person named App&#225;ji Kulkarni has assumed the form of a <hi>Sambandh</hi> and guards the buried treasures in his house. When anybody tries to dig up the buried money, the ghost enters the body of his daughter-in-law and begins to dance and cry out loudly, and does not allow any one to touch his treasure. It is also said that he strikes the ground with his stick at night. Another similar instance is cited in the case of the village of Latvade in the Shirol Peta, where B&#225;pujipant Kulkarni continues to guard his house after death. He does not allow anybody to live in the house, and if any one is bold enough to sleep there at night, the spirit of B&#225;puji appears and throws him out of the house. The house is therefore uninhabited at present. His wife has adopted a son, but he has to live in another village<corr>,</corr> Vadange.<note n="8">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>








<pb id="pb60" n="60"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch6" n="VI" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER VI.</head><head><hi>THE EVIL EYE AND THE SCARING OF GHOSTS.</hi></head><p>Hindus generally believe in the effects of the evil eye. If an accident befall any thing of value, or it undergoes any sudden change, it is said to be due to the effects of an evil eye. In order to escape from the influence of an evil eye, people begin the use of incantations and charms on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Thursday and finish them on the third or the fifth day. Small children, domestic animals, and beautiful objects are generally liable to be affected by an evil eye.
</p><p>The following are some of the methods of evading the effects of an evil eye.


</p><p><hi>1st.</hi>&#8212;Dry chillies are waved round the body of the affected person and thrown into the fire, and if they do not thereupon make a loud noise, it is said that the effects of an evil eye are averted.
</p><p><hi>2nd.</hi>&#8212;Mustard seed and salt are waved round the face of a child and then thrown into the fire.
</p><p><hi>3rd.</hi>&#8212;Alum is waved round the child and then thrown into fire. The piece of alum thus thrown is sometimes believed to be changed into the form of a man or a woman. From this, conjectures are made as to the sex of the person by whose evil eye the patient is affected. The form or the figure is then broken by a toe of the left foot of the patient, and dry chillies, garlic, hair, rubbish from the house and salt are mixed in the alum powder. The mixture is waved round the patient three times and then thrown into fire. Meanwhile the sorcerer repeats the names of all persons, things and evil spirits suspected by him. After this performance has been repeated three times, the fire is deposited in a public place where three roads meet.
</p><p><hi>4th.</hi>&#8212;If the evil eye is believed to be that of a ghost, the sorcerer mutters some words to himself, waves ashes round the affected child, and blows them in the air.
</p><p><hi>5th.</hi>&#8212;The evil eye of a tiger is removed from an affected animal in the following manner. An oil lamp is burnt in the eye of a dead tiger and the lamp is waved round the animal by a Mah&#225;r. The Mah&#225;r is given a loaf prepared from eight kinds of grain.
</p><p><hi>6th.</hi>&#8212;Copper amulets and black cotton strings charmed by a sorcerer are also tied round the neck or arms of the patient.<note n="1">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>


</p><p>When a child is to be removed from one village to another, rice is scattered at the boundary of the village, at the bridges, rivers, creeks, etc, that are crossed during the journey. Cocoanuts are waved round the child and thrown away at the boundary of the village and at places supposed to be haunted by ghosts. Before entering a house in a new village, a small quantity of boiled rice, bread, <pb id="pb61" n="61"/>or grains of rice are waved round the child and thrown away. It is believed that, when black ointment is applied to the eyes, cheeks, or forehead of a child, there is no fear of its being affected by an evil eye. This also depends on the position of the stars at the birth of a child. If anybody sees a beautiful thing and praises it, there is a chance of its being affected by an evil eye. It is believed that children, animals, trees, and even wood and stones, are apt to be affected by an evil eye. In order to avoid injury from an evil eye, cocoanut shells or a shoe are tied on a conspicuous part of a tree or a creeping plant, black beads known as <hi>Vajrabuttu</hi> are tied round the necks of children, and <hi>cowries</hi> and black beads are tied round the necks of animals. Even grown up persons are affected by an evil eye. When a man is very ill or frequently becomes unconscious, cocoanuts, fowls and boiled rice are waved round him and thrown away.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#224;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>When the effects of an evil eye cannot be removed by ordinary methods, the evil influence is said to have entered through the bones, &#8216;<hi>H&#225;di drusta padali</hi>.&#8217; In order to remove it people bring the bone of an animal in the evening, and after besmearing it with oil and turmeric powder, wash it in hot water. It is dressed in a yellow cloth, and black and red ointments are applied to it. It is then waved round the affected person, and thrown away in some public place where three roads meet.<note n="2">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>For evading the effects of an evil eye, salt, mustard seed, hair, garlic, dry leaves of onions, dry chillies, and seven small stones from the road are put on the fire. The fire is then waved round the body of the affected person and thrown away. Charmed black cotton strings are turned over the burning incense and tied round the arm or the neck. Charmed ashes from the temples of certain deities are also applied to the forehead of the affected person.<note n="3">School Master, Achare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At <corr sic="Ibhr&#225;mpur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr> in the Ratn&#225;giri District, it is believed that a person whose eyes have come under the influence of evil stars possesses the power of the evil eye. Ashes are taken on a mango leaf, and charmed with the <hi>mantras</hi> or incantations for an evil eye, and then they are applied to the forehead of the affected person.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Ibhrampur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The people of Poladpur in the Kol&#225;ba District believe the effects of an evil eye to be as follows. A healthy child becomes sickly and cries, a man may suffer from indigestion or loss of appetite, a cow or a she-buffalo yielding plenty of milk suddenly ceases to give milk or gives blood in place of it, a good image is disfigured or broken, and even stones are shattered to pieces by the effects of an evil eye.
</p><p>The following devices are used to ward off such evil effects. A black mark is made on the forehead of children. Black beads called <hi>Drustamani</hi>, and <hi>Vajrabuttu</hi> are tied round their necks. Marking nuts and cowries tied with a black thread are fastened round the necks of animals. A little black spot is marked on an image. A worn out shoe or a sandal is tied to the fruit-yielding trees. Salt and mustard seed are waved thrice round the face of a child repeating &#8220;<hi>Ishta mishta kony&#225; p&#225;pinichi drushta</hi>&#8221; and thrown into the fire. Some people roll a cotton thread round a curry stone, wave it three times round the patient, and then put it into the fire; if the thread burns, the evil eye is held to have been removed. If the evil eye be on the food, three morsels of food are first raised to the mouth, and then thrown into the fire. Sacred ashes are applied to trees and creeping plants to remove the effects of an evil eye.<note n="5">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>The people of Khopoli in the Kol&#225;ba District believe that the evil eye can be diverted from living creatures only, and not from inanimate things such as a stone or an earthen image. Sacred ashes are applied to the forehead of the suffering child by <pb id="pb62" n="62"/>repeating the <hi>R&#225;m raksha stotra</hi>, <hi>i.e<corr>.</corr></hi>, the protecting praises of R&#225;ma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. Among Br&#225;hmans, rice grains are waved thrice round the face of a child and put into water. The water is then thrown away. Even flowers are waved round the faces of small children in the evening and thrown away.<note n="1">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Chauk in the Karjat taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District, some people wave the left shoe thrice round the body of the affected person for the purpose of evading the effects of an evil eye. A red hot iron bar is also cooled in water mixed with turmeric powder.<note n="2">School Master, Chauk, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At Shirg&#225;on in the M&#225;him taluka of the Th&#225;na District water is drawn in a brass or a copper pot in the evening, and turmeric powder, rice, and any other edible articles on which the evil eye has fallen are put into it. Twentyone date leaves, each of them with a knot, are then waved round the body of the affected person and thrown into the water pot, burning coals being dropped into the mixture. The pot is then waved thrice round the body of the affected person, and kept in a corner of the bedroom for one night, with a basket, a broom, and a sandal or an old shoe placed on the top. It is then thrown away in the morning in some public place where three roads meet. If the water becomes red, it is supposed that the evil eye has been removed.<note n="3">School Master, Shirgaon, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The effects of an evil eye are sometimes visible on the face of a child in the form of small red pustules. The appearance of such pustules is called <hi>Ch&#225;k padane</hi>.<note n="4">School Master, Padghe, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>If a person is affected by an evil eye at the time of taking his meals, he loses his appetite. He also becomes weaker day by day. One of the modes of removing these evils is to wave fresh date leaves three times round the face of the affected person, and to throw them into water. Some people take water in a copper plate and extinguish in it burning sticks of the tamarind tree, after waving them round the body of the affected person.<note n="5">School Master, Mal&#225;d, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Kh&#225;rb&#225;v in the Bassein taluka of the Th&#225;na District, five pieces of broken tiles are made red hot and put into water in which a little quantity of all the cooked food in the house has been mixed. Turmeric powder is also put into it. A pen knife or some other iron instrument is then turned five times in the water. A winnowing basket and a broom are waved thrice round the face of the affected person, and placed over the water pot.<note n="6">School Master, Kh&#225;rb&#225;v, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>At Dah&#225;nu in the Th&#225;na District, two big stones, of which one has been waved round the face of a person affected by an evil eye, are struck one against the other. If the stone breaks, it is believed that the evil effect has been removed. Cowdung is mixed with water in a brass or a copper plate, and dust from a public road, hair, and burning black cotton cloth are put into another small vessel. This vessel is then waved round the person, and placed upside down over the mixture of cowdung. If it sticks to the brass plate, this is supposed to be due to the evil eye.<note n="7">School Master<corr sic=".">,</corr> Dah&#225;nu<corr sic=".">,</corr> Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>The people of Kolh&#225;pur believe in the effects of an evil eye. A child suffering from an evil eye turns pale and thin, and suffers from headache. To avoid these effects, elderly women make a mark with lamp black on the face or brow of the child. Boiled rice and curds, and bread and oil are also passed round the face of a child, and thrown into a public road.<note n="8">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke<corr sic=".">,</corr> Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>Generally, in the Konkan districts, opprobrious names are given to children when they are sickly, always crying, and weak, or when they are short lived. These names are <pb id="pb63" n="63"/><hi>Marya</hi>, <hi>Rodya</hi>, <hi>Kerya</hi>, etc. It is believed that children improve in health when called by such opprobrious names.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Opprobrious names such as <hi>Dhondu</hi>, <hi>Kondu</hi>, <hi>Keru</hi>, are given to children in families in which the first children are shortlived. But their real names are different. The names of the wellknown arithmetician Keru N&#225;na Chhatre and his son Kondopant Chhatre are examples of opprobrious names.<note n="2">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Among high class Hindus, the first son is not generally called by his real name, but by one of the opprobrious names given above.<note n="3">School Master, Bhay&#225;nd&#225;r, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>Children are sometimes weighed with shoes or sandals, and also with cowdung. In some cases, their nostrils are bored, especially the right one.<note n="4">School Master, Dah&#225;nu, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>Hindus generally call their children by the names of their deities and ancestors, and they attribute the premature death of their children to their own misbehaviour towards such ancestors, or to their having abused them; they fear that such abuse or misbehaviour has offended the ancestors. To avoid their displeasure and the consequent death of their children, the people give opprobrious names to their next born such as <hi>Dagadya</hi>, <hi>Dhondya</hi>, <hi>Gundya</hi>, <hi>Dandya</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>Kerya</hi>, <hi>Ukirdya</hi>, <hi>Kondya</hi>, <hi>Lobhya</hi>, etc. The custom of tattooing one side of the body of females also prevails in the Kolh&#225;pur District, especially in cases where the children in a family are shortlived.<note n="5">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>In the <hi>Pur&#225;nas</hi> there are instances of males being transformed into females, and females into males. For example, the female Amba was transformed into a male called Shikhandi and the male N&#225;rad was transformed into a female. Arjuna, the third brother of the P&#225;ndavas is said to have changed his sex, and turned into Bruhannada.<note n="6">School Master, <corr sic="Ibrahmpur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, there are no instances known of a change of sex. The goddess Yallamma has a high reputation in this district for making a change in the habits and deportments of men and women, especially among low caste people. It is believed that the curse of this goddess has the power of destroying the virility of males, whereupon they behave like females. Many instances of this type can be seen at the fair of the goddess Yallamma, which is held in <hi>M&#225;rgashirsha</hi> (December); men dressed in women&#8217;s clothes and vice versa are often seen at this fair.<note n="8">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>In Western India, iron nails are generally used when any spirit is to be buried in the ground. Other metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, are sometimes offered to the ghosts. The blood of fowls and goats is also offered to them. When incense is burnt before a sorcerer, the spirit enters into his body. Water is charmed and sprinkled over the body of a person attacked by an evil spirit. Rice and <hi>udid</hi> grains are required for exorcising spirits. Red powder <hi>Pinjar</hi>, turmeric powder, black ointment <hi>k&#225;jal</hi>, lemons, <hi>Narakya Wuda</hi> a kind of incense, betel-leaves, betelnuts, cocoanuts, mango leaves, <hi>Nirgu&#7693;i</hi> leaves, and pieces of cloth are also used for the same purpose.<note n="9">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Cane sticks are used by people as a protection against evil spirits. A stick cut from the tree known as <hi>P&#225;ndhri</hi> is also used as protection.

</p><p>Iron nails and horseshoes are driven into the threshold or on to the door of a house on the full moon day or the last day of the Hindu calendar month at evening time, to prevent the entrance of evil spirits. Dirty localities being considered to be haunts of evil spirits, people living in such localities burn incense in their houses every day. While exorcising evil spirits the sorcerers throw charmed <hi>Udid</hi> grains and <hi>R&#225;le</hi> panic seeds on the body of the diseased, or place these things below <hi>his</hi> bed. Rings made of metals of five kinds,&#8212;iron, copper, brass, silver and gold&#8212;are charmed on an eclipse day, and worn by people. Red lead and cowries are tied to the necks or feet of animals as protection against evil spirits. The spirits that haunt buried treasures are pacified by the blood of fowls and goats when digging up such treasures.<note n="9">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>Certain <hi>mantras</hi> are written on a paper, and the paper is tied to a black cotton string, or the paper is put into a copper amulet, and then tied to a black cotton string.

</p><p>At M&#225;l&#225;d in the Th&#225;na District, copper amulets and charmed black cotton threads in the name of K&#225;l Bhairav, an incarnation of the god Shiva, are used as protective against evil spirits.

</p><p>At Kolh&#225;pur, the use of amulets is generally resorted to by people suffering from the attacks of evil spirits or from malarial fevers. The sorcerer who exorcises the evil spirits writes certain <hi>mantras</hi> on a paper, or draws certain symbols and repeats the <hi>mantras</hi> over them. The paper is then wrapped in an amulet made of copper or silver, and fastened to a cotton thread. This amulet is tied round the arm or the neck of the diseased.

</p><p>A sacred circle is frequently used as a protection from spirits. The sorcerer draws a circle on the ground, with his stick, and the following articles are put inside it. Cocoanuts, lemons, red lead, and a <hi>Kohala</hi> gourd. Fowls are also sacrificed to this circle. The filling in of this circle is called <hi>m&#225;nda bharane</hi> by the exorcists.<note n="4">School Master, B&#225;ndivade, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Rice or <hi>Udid</hi> grain, and ashes charmed by <hi>mantras</hi>, are scattered round a certain area of land, or are given to a person supposed to be affected by evil spirits. The spirits cannot enter a place charmed in this manner. They are also scattered round the place supposed to be haunted by evil spirits in the belief that neither evil spirits nor snakes can transgress the boundary thus marked by a sorcerer.<note n="5">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Formerly sages and saints used to make such sacred circles round their residence, repeating certain <hi>mantras</hi>, for their protection from evil spirits. It is believed that the spirits cannot enter or leave these enchanted circles. They used to bury bottles containing such spirits at the boundaries of these circles. There are many such places in the Kolh&#225;pur District, such as Bur&#225;ns&#225;heb of Brahmapuri, the S&#225;dhubuwa of Panh&#225;la, and B&#225;bu J&#225;m&#225;l at Kolh&#225;pur.<note n="6">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>

</p><p>Among the Hindus in Western India, for the purpose of helping the spirit to go to heaven safely, and for securing its goodwill towards the survivors, after death ceremonies called the <hi>Shr&#225;ddhas</hi> are generally performed. Some perform these ceremonies once a year in the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi>, and others perform them twice or thrice<corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi><corr>,</corr> on the anniversary day of the deceased as well as in the dark half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi>, which is generally known as the <hi>manes&#8217;</hi> fortnight (<hi>pitru paksha</hi>).<note n="12">School Master, Devgad, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The funeral solemnities performed from the 1st to the 14th day from the death of the deceased are as described below:&#8212;
</p><p>On the first day, at the time of burning the dead body, a plot of ground is purified by repeating certain <hi>mantras</hi>, and the corpse is then placed on it. Before setting the funeral pile on fire, balls of boiled rice or wheat flour are put on the face, the forehead, arms and the chest of the corpse. Such balls are placed <pb id="pb67" n="67"/>on the body of the deceased only when death has taken place on an unlucky day, or when there is an unlucky conjunction of stars. The son, or some other near relative, of the deceased generally performs these rites with the help of a Br&#225;hman priest. On the third day he goes to the burning place, collects the ashes of the deceased, and throws them into the sea. On this occasion he is accompanied by the relatives of the deceased. Rich persons who are able to go to Benares keep the bones of their deceased parents and throw them into the Ganges at Pray&#225;ga near Benares after performing certain <hi>Shr&#225;ddhas</hi> there. The giving of oblations continues daily till the tenth day. The oblations of the tenth day are called <hi>Das Pinda</hi>. The rites of the eleventh day are called <hi>Ekotistha</hi>. On the eleventh day the person performing the rites has to change his sacred thread, after sipping a little cow&#8217;s urine. Cooked food is prepared at the place where the rites of the eleventh day are performed, and Br&#225;hmans are fed there, or at least thirty-two mouthfuls of cooked food are offered to the sacred fire. A big ball of boiled rice is put before the sacred fire or near the Br&#225;hmans taking their meals. This ball is then thrown into the sea. A male calf is branded, worshipped and let loose. This calf is called <hi>Vasu</hi>, and is considered sacred by the villagers. On the 11th day, special ceremonies for propitiating the eight <hi>Vasus</hi> and the eleven <hi>Rudras</hi> are performed, and gifts of a plot of ground, a cow, cooking vessels, various kinds of corn, golden images, silver and copper coins, clothes, shoes, umbrellas, bedding, etc. are given to the Br&#225;hmans collected there. On the 13th day after death a feast is given to 13 or more Br&#225;hmans and the other relatives. <hi>Navak&#225;d&#225;n</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the gift of a ship and <hi>Goprad&#225;n</hi><corr>,</corr> <hi>i.e.</hi>, of a cow and a calf, are also given to the Br&#225;hmans on the understanding that they will help the soul of the dead while crossing the river Vaitarna.<note n="1">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>

</p><p>At Bankavli in the D&#225;poli taluka of the Ratn&#225;giri District, in order to prevent the soul from assuming the form of a ghost, there is a custom of tying a piece of <hi>Gulvel</hi>, a species of moonseed, or the seed of a vegetable known as <hi>M&#225;thbh&#225;ji</hi>, round the neck of the corpse before burning it. It is also believed that, by doing this, the soul is prevented from troubling the survivors.<note n="3">School Master, Bankavli, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Poladpur in the Kol&#225;ba District, some villagers drive an iron nail into the head of the corpse before it is taken to the funeral ground. They believe that, in consequence, the soul of the deceased will not turn into an evil spirit. Some people scatter grain on the road while the corpse is being carried to the cremation ground.<note n="4">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>Among the Hindus in the Konkan, as well as in the Deccan, dead bodies are generally burnt, but under the following circumstances they are buried.
</p><p>Persons dying of small pox, women dying in childbirth or during their menses, children dying within six months from their birth, and <hi>Sany&#225;sis</hi> are buried. The bodies of persons suffering from leprosy are necessarily buried.<note n="5">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Among Ling&#225;yats the bodies are always buried. Certain <hi>mantras</hi> are repeated while burying or burning the dead body.

Cocoanuts and camphor cakes are placed on the body, and it is set on fire. Among the Ling&#225;yats and Gos&#225;vis the dead are buried. Before burying, the Ling&#225;yats have to take a written order from their priest, the Ayya or Jangam. The paper is then tied to the neck of the deceased, and the body is placed in a bag made of new cloth, the head being allowed to remain out of the bag. <hi>Bhasma</hi> or ashes, salt and camphor are also put into the bag along with the corpse, which is then buried. The Jangam repeats <hi>mantras</hi> when the body is in the grave. No such written order is necessary for the burial of Gos&#225;vis. A cocoanut is broken on the head of the corpse at the time of burying it. Among high class Hindus the corpse is carried to the funeral ground in a bier made of bamboos. Among the Ling&#225;yats a gaily dressed frame called <hi>Makhar</hi> is prepared on the bier, and the body is dressed with clothes and head dress and seated in the <hi>Makhar</hi>. Some of them carry the dead body in a bag made of blanket. There is a custom of keeping foot-prints on the spot where a <hi>Sany&#225;si</hi> is buried, and they are daily worshipped by the people.<note n="1">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note> Among the K&#225;thawatis of Th&#225;na and Kol&#225;ba <corr sic="districts">Districts</corr> the dead body is first buried, and after a few days the skeleton is taken out of the grave and then burnt as usual.<note n="2">School Master, Mokhade, Th&#225;na.</note> Among the high class Hindus the moustaches are shaved at the death of parents<corr>,</corr> paternal uncle and elder brother.

</p><p>Among high class Hindus boiled rice is daily offered to the dead after a portion has been thrown into the fire, the remainder being given to the crows. The portion thrown in the fire is called <hi>Vaishvadev</hi>, and that which is given to the crows is called <hi>K&#225;gw&#225;s</hi>. Among other Hindus it is given on the last day of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> and on the date of the father&#8217;s death, annually.<note n="6">School Master, Kelw&#225;-M&#225;him, Th&#225;na.</note> Oblations of boiled rice are given to the dead every day, on the last day of the Hindu calendar month, on the date of a person&#8217;s death every month, on the same date of the dark half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> every year. These oblations are put out of the house before taking the meals. It is believed that the ancestors come down in the form of crows to partake of these offerings.<note n="7">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Oblations of cooked food are also offered to a cow, and considered thus to be received by the dead.

The flame of the lamp is directed towards the south as it is believed that the soul goes to heaven by the south. A ball of boiled rice and a little quantity of water or milk is kept daily for the first ten days near the lamp while repeating the name of the deceased and of the <hi>gotra</hi> to which it belonged. The lamp is taken out of the house on the 11th day.<note n="9">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>

All those things which can be purified by washing are washed and taken back, while things like <pb id="pb69" n="69"/>earthen pots, cooked food, etc. are thrown away, special care being taken to break these pots, so that they may not be used again. Even the walls of the house are white washed.<note n="1">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> The earthen pots that are required for the funeral rites of the dead are all broken. One which is required for boiling water to bathe the corpse is broken when the body is carried to the funeral ground. Of the rest, one is broken at the funeral pile after the son has passed thrice round the pile with an earthen vessel filled with water. It is believed that birds and animals drinking water out of these vessels would be infected by disease, and this is the reason why these pots are broken. The mourners who use earthen vessels during the mourning break them at the end of the mourning period.<note n="2">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note> Among the Agris of Chaul in the Kol&#225;ba District, all earthen vessels in the house are broken on the eleventh day after a death in the family, the chief reason assigned for this act being that the wishes and desires of the deceased might lurk in the earthen vessels and cause trouble to the inmates of the house.<note n="3">School Master, Chowl, Kol&#225;ba.</note>

It is considered very lucky to secure the help of these spirits. The temple ministrant then requests the deity to give a <hi>Kaul</hi> or omen. For this purpose, the temple ministrant calls on the deity to enter his body, and when he is possessed by the spirit of the deity, he allows the applicant to take with him one of the deity&#8217;s servants for a fixed period. The Gurav, or the ministrant, then explains to the person the period for which the spirit servant is given, and the amount of the annual tribute required to be given to the deity for the use of her servant. He also gives him a cocoanut and sacred ashes. The applicant then returns home, believing that the spirit servant will follow him, and from that time he prospers.

</p><p>In order that they may get the auspicious sight of a deity early in the morning, Hindus generally plant the <hi>Umbar</hi> and <hi>Tulsi</hi> trees in front of their houses, and worship them daily. The juice of the root of the <hi>Umbar</hi> has a cooling effect, and hence it is freely used in cases of measles or itch. Its sap is also used as medicine for swellings. It is very pleasant to sit under the shade of this tree, and as it is believed that the god Datt&#225;traya resides beneath this tree, it is held very sacred by the Hindus.<note n="7">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p><hi>Pipal</hi>&#8212;The <hi>Pipal</hi> tree is considered very sacred because it is believed that the god Brahma resides in the roots, the god Vishnu in the trunk, and the god Shiva on the top of this tree.

After her death she was burnt, but on her burning ground there grew the <hi>Tulsi</hi> plant. As Krishna loved Vrunda very dearly, he began to love this plant also, and hence the image of B&#225;l Krishna, or the god Vishnu, is married to this plant every year on the 12th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#225;rtik</hi> (November).<note n="3">School Master, Dah&#225;nu, Th&#225;na.</note> As it is also believed that the god Vishnu resides in the <hi>Tulsi</hi> plant, the worship of this plant is equivalent to the worship of the god Vishnu.<note n="4">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>

</p><p>In the Konkan districts there is a class of women known as Bh&#225;vinis who are said to be married to <hi>Khanjir</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, a dagger belonging to the god.

A woman wishing to abandon her husband goes to the temple of a village deity at night, and in presence of the people assembled in that temple she takes oil from the lamp burning in the temple, and pours it upon her head. This process is called <hi>Deval righ&#772;ane</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, to enter into the service of the temple. After she has poured sweet oil from the lamp upon her head, she has no further connection with her husband. She becomes the maid servant of the temple, and is free to behave as she likes. Daughters of such Bh&#225;vinis who do not wish to marry, undergo the process of <hi>shesa bharane</hi>, and follow the occupation of their mothers. The sons of the Bh&#225;vinis have an equal right to the property of their mother, but any daughter who marries a lawful husband loses her share in the property of her mother. A Devali follows the occupation of blowing the horn or cornet, and is entitled to hold the torches in the marriage ceremonies of the people in the village. Many of them learn the art of playing upon the tabour&#8212;<hi>mrudunga</hi>&#8212;and are useful to <hi>Kathekaris</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, those who recite legends of the gods with music and singing. Some of them become farmers while others are unoccupied.
</p><p>Bh&#225;vinis follow the occupation of a maid-servant in the temple, but their real occupation is that of public women. They are not scorned by the public. On the contrary, they are required to be present at the time of a marriage to tie the marriage-string&#8212;<hi>Mangalsutra</hi>&#8212;of a bride, for they are supposed to enjoy perpetual unwidowhood&#8212;&#8216;<hi>Janma suw&#225;sini</hi>.&#8217; Some of the houses of Bh&#225;vinis become the favourite resorts of gamblers and vagabonds.

Some people go to the <corr sic="snakes,">snake&#8217;s</corr> abode <hi>V&#225;rul</hi>&#8212;an ant-hill&#8212;on this day to worship the snake itself, if they happen to catch sight of it.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>It is said that at Battisa Shir&#225;le in the Belg&#225;um District the real <hi>N&#225;ga</hi> comes out of its abode below the earth on this day, and is worshipped by the people. Milk and <hi>l&#225;hya</hi>, parched rice, are put outside the house at night on this day with the intention that they may be consumed by a snake. Hindus do not dig or plough the earth on <hi>N&#225;ga panchami</hi> day. Even vegetables are not cut and fried on this day by some people.<note n="2">School Master, K&#225;lshe, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Earthen images of snakes are worshipped by some people in the Konkan districts on the <hi>N&#225;ga panchami</hi> day. The <hi>N&#225;ga</hi> is considered to be a Br&#225;hman by caste, and it is believed that the family of the person who kills a snake becomes extinct. The cobra being considered a Br&#225;hman, its dead body is adorned with the <hi>j&#225;nawe</hi>, and then burnt as that of a human being. A copper coin is also thrown into its funeral pile.<note n="3">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At certain villages in the Deccan a big earthen image of a snake is consecrated in a public place on the <hi>N&#225;ga panchami</hi> day, and worshipped by Hindus in general. Women sing their songs in circles before this image while men perform <hi>tam&#225;sh&#225;s</hi> by its side. In fact, the day is enjoyed by the people as a holiday. The snake is removed next day, and an idol in the form of a man made of mud is seated in its place. This idol is called Shir&#225;lshet, who is said once to have been a king and to have ruled over this earth for one and one-fourths of a <hi>ghataka</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, for half an hour only. This day, is observed as a day of rejoicing by the people.<note id="n81.4" n="4">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>The names of the snake deities are Takshaka, V&#225;suki and Shesha. Their shrines are at Kolh&#225;pur, N&#225;gothane, Prayaga, N&#225;gadev&#225;chi W&#225;di and Subramhanya.

</p><p>There is a shrine of a snake deity at S&#225;vantw&#225;di. The management of the shrine is in the hands of the State officials. It is believed that a real snake resides therein.<note n="5">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>There is a shrine of a snake deity at Aw&#225;s in the Alib&#225;g taluka of the Kol&#225;ba District, where a great fair is held every year on the 14th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#225;rtik</hi> (November). It is said that persons suffering from snakebites recover when taken in time to this temple.<note n="6">School Master, Apte, Panwel, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>It is said that a covetous person who acquires great wealth during his life-time and dies without enjoying it, or without issue, becomes a snake after death, and guards his buried treasures. At Kolh&#225;pur there was a <hi>S&#225;wk&#225;r</hi>&#8212;money-lender&#8212;named Kodulkar who is said to have become a snake, and to guard his treasures. In the village of Kailava in the Panh&#225;la petha of the Kolh&#225;pur District there is a snake in the house of a Kulkarni, who scares away those who try to enter the storehouse of the Kulkarni.<note n="7">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>It is a general belief among the Hindus that snakes guard treasures. It is said that there are certain places guarded by snakes in Goa territory. Persons who were compelled to abandon Portuguese territory owing to religious persecutions at the hands of the Portuguese buried their treasures beneath the ground. Those who died during exile are said to have become <hi>bhuts</hi> or ghosts, and it is believed that they guard their buried treasures in the form of snakes.<note n="8">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The Hindus generally believe that the snakes who guard buried treasures do not allow any one to go near them. The snake frightens those who try to approach, but when he wishes <pb id="pb76" n="76"/>to hand over the treasure to anybody he goes to that person at night, and tells him in a dream that the treasure buried at such and such a place belongs to him, and requests him to take it over. After the person has taken possession of the treasure as requested, the snake disappears from the spot.<note n="1">School Master, Chawk, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>It is said that a snake which guards treasure is generally very old, white in complexion, and has long hair on its body.<note n="2">School Master, Basani, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Hindus worship the image of a snake made of <hi>Darbha</hi> grass or of silk thread on the <hi>Anant Chaturdashi</hi> day, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the 14th day of the bright half of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October), and observe that day as a holiday. Legends of the exploits of the god are related with music and singing on this day.<note n="3">School Master, Pendur, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>A snake festival is observed in the N&#225;geshwar temple at Aw&#225;s in the Kol&#225;ba District on the night of the 14th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#225;rtika</hi> (November). Nearly four hundred devotees of the god Shankar assemble in the temple, holding in their hands <hi>vetra-sarpa</hi> long cane sticks with snake images at their ends. They advance dancing and repeating certain words, and take turns round the temple till midnight. After getting the permission of the chief devotee, they scatter throughout the neighbouring villages with small axes in their hands, and cut down, and bring from the gardens, cocoanuts, plantains, and other edible things that are seen on their way. They return to the temple after two hours, the last man being the chief devotee called <hi>Kuwark&#225;ndya</hi>. The fruits are then distributed among the people assembled at the temple. Nobody interferes with them on this day in taking away cocoanuts and other fruits from the village gardens. On the next day they go dancing in the same manner to the Kanakeshwar hill with the snake sticks in their hands.<note n="4">School Master, Chawl, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Deccan no special snake festivals like those described above are celebrated. But in the temples devoted to snake deities, on the full moon day of <hi>K&#225;rtik</hi>, which is sacred to the snake deity, the deity is worshipped with special pomp, and the crests of the temples are illuminated on that night.<note n="5">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>The village cures for snakebite are:&#8212;
</p><p>1. The use of charmed water and the repetition of <hi>mantras</hi> by a sorcerer.
</p><p>2. The use of certain roots and herbs as medicines.
</p><p>3. The removal of the sufferer to the neighbouring temple.
</p><p>4. Branding the wound with fire.
</p><p>5. The drinking of soapnut juice, or of water in which copper coins have been boiled by the patient, who is thus made to vomit the snake poison.<note n="6">School Master, Jambivali, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Deccan a person suffering from snakebite is taken to a village temple, and the ministrant is requested to give him holy water. The deity is also invoked. Thus keeping the person for one night in the temple, he is carried to his house the following day if cured. The vows made to the deity for the recovery of the person are then fulfilled. There is one <hi>turabat</hi>, a tomb of <hi>Avalia</hi> a Mahomedan saint, at Panh&#225;la where persons suffering from snakebite are made to sit near the tomb, and it is said that they are cured. In some villages there are enchanted trees of <hi>Kadulimb</hi> where persons placed under the shade of such trees are cured of snakebites. Some people tie a stone round the neck of the sufferer as soon as he is better, repeating the words <hi>Adi Gudi Im&#225;m</hi> the name of a Mahomedan saint. After recovery from snakebite the person is taken to the mosque of the <hi>Adi Gudi Im&#225;m S&#225;heb</hi>, where the stone is untied before the tomb, and <hi>j&#225;gri</hi> equal to the weight of the stone is offered. A feast is also given to the <hi>Muj&#225;war</hi> or ministrant of the mosque. There is at <corr sic="persent">present</corr> a famous enchanter&#8212;<hi>M&#225;ntrika</hi>&#8212;at Sat&#225;ra who cures persons suffering from snakebite. It is said that he throws charmed water on the body of the sufferer, and in a few minutes the snake <pb id="pb77" n="77"/>begins to speak through the victim. The sorcerer enquires what the snake wants. The snake gives reasons for biting the person. When any thing thus asked for by the snake is offered, the victim comes to his senses, and is cured. There are many witnesses to the above fact.<note n="1">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>At <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr> in the Ratn&#225;giri District chickens numbering from twenty to twenty-five are applied to the wound caused by the snakebite. A chicken has the power of drawing out the poison from the body through the wound, but this causes the death of the chicken. The remedy above described is sure to be successful if it is tried within three hours of the person being bitten. There are several other medicines which act on the snakebite, but they must be given very promptly. There are some men in this village who give charmed water for snake or any other bites. Many persons suffering from snakebite have been cured by the use of <hi>mantras</hi> and charmed water.<note n="2">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Water from the tanks of Vet&#225;vare in the S&#225;vantw&#225;di State and M&#225;njare in Goa territory is generally used as medicine for snakebite. It is believed that by the power of <hi>mantras</hi> a snake can be prevented from entering or leaving a particular area. This process is called &#8216;<hi>sarpa b&#225;ndhane</hi>&#8217;. There are some sorcerers who can draw snakes out of their holes by the use of their <hi>mantras</hi>, and carry them away without touching them with their hands.<note n="3">School Master, Ubh&#225;d&#225;nda, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Adivare, in the R&#225;j&#225;pur taluka, roots of certain herbs are mixed in water and applied to the wound caused by the snakebite, and given to the sufferer to drink.<note n="4">School Master, Adivare, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At N&#225;ringre in the Ratn&#225;giri District, persons suffering from snakebite are given the juice of <hi>Kadulimb</hi> leaves, and are kept in the temple of Hanum&#225;n. The feet of the deity are washed with holy water, and the water is given to the victim to drink.<note n="5">School Master, N&#225;ringre, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>A snake is believed to have a white jewel or <hi>mani</hi> in its head, and it loses its life when this jewel is removed. This jewel has the power of drawing out the poison of snakebite. When it is applied to the wound, it becomes green, but when kept in milk for sometime, it loses its greenness and reverts to its usual white colour. It gives out to the milk all the poison that has been absorbed from the wound, and the milk becomes green. This jewel can be used several times as an absorbent of the poison of snakebite. The green milk must be buried under ground, so that it may not be used again by any one else.<note n="6">School Master, K&#225;lshe, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>It is believed that an old snake having long hair on its body has a jewel in its head. This jewel is compared with the colours of a rainbow. The snake can take this jewel from its head at night, and search for food in its lustre. Such snakes never come near the habitation of human beings, but always reside in the depth of the jungle. This species of snake is called <hi>Deva Sarpa</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, a snake belonging to a deity. It is related that a snake was born of a woman in the Kinkar&#8217;s house at Tard&#225;l in the S&#225;ngli State, and another one in the Gabale&#8217;s house at Kolh&#225;pur.<note n="7">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>








<pb id="pb78" n="78"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch8" n="VIII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER VIII.</head><head><hi>TOTEMISM AND FETISHISM.</hi></head><p>The worship of totems, or <hi>Devaks</hi>, prevails among Hindus in Western India. The term <hi>Devak</hi> is applied to the deity or deities worshipped at the beginning of a thread or a marriage ceremony. The ceremony is as follows: A small quantity of rice is put into a winnowing fan, and with it six small sticks of the <hi>Umbar</hi> tree, each covered with mango leaves and cotton thread. These are worshipped as deities. Near the winnowing fan is kept an earthen or copper vessel filled with rice, turmeric, red powder, betelnuts, sweet balls made of wheat flour, ghi and sugar; and on the top of the vessel is a small sprig of mango and a cocoanut covered with cotton thread. This vessel is also worshipped as a deity, and offerings of sweet eatables are made to it. After the worship of this vessel, the regular ceremony of <hi>Puny&#225;havachana</hi> is performed. Twenty-seven <hi>M&#225;trik&#225;s</hi>, or village and local deities, represented by betelnuts are consecrated in a new winnowing fan or a bamboo basket. Seven <hi>M&#225;trik&#225;s</hi> are made of mango leaves, six of which contain <hi>durva</hi> grass, and the seventh <hi>darbha</hi> grass. Each of them is bound with a raw cotton thread separately. They are worshipped along with a <hi>Kalasha</hi> or a copper <hi>lota</hi> as mentioned above. This copper <hi>lota</hi> is filled with rice, betelnuts, turmeric, etc., a sprig of mango leaves is placed on the <hi>lota</hi>, and a cocoanut is put over it. The <hi>lota</hi> is also bound with a cotton thread. Sandalpaste, rice, flowers, and <hi>durva</hi> grass are required for its worship. An oil lamp called <hi>Arati</hi> is waved round the <hi>devak</hi>, the parents, and the boy or the girl whose thread or marriage ceremony is to be performed. A <hi>Suw&#225;sini</hi> is called and requested to wave this <hi>Arati</hi>, and the silver coin which is put into the <hi>Arati</hi> by the parents is taken by her. The father takes the winnowing fan and the mother takes the <hi>Kalasha</hi>, and they are carried from the <hi>mandap</hi> to the <hi>devak</hi> consecrated in the house. A lighted lamp is kept continually burning near this <hi>devak</hi> till the completion of the ceremony. After completion of the thread or marriage ceremony the <hi>devak</hi> is again worshipped, and the ceremony comes to an end. The deity in the <hi>devak</hi> is requested to depart on the second or the fourth day from the date of its consecration. No mourning is observed during the period the <hi>devak</hi> remains installed in the house.

</p><p>It is believed among the Hindus that the deity <hi>Satw&#225;i</hi> protects children for the first three months from their birth. The deity is worshipped on the fifth day from the birth of a child, and if there occurs any omission or error in the worship of that deity, the child begins to cry, or does not keep good health. On such occasions the parents of the child make certain vows to the deity, and if the child recovers, the parents go to a jungle, and collect seven small stones.

</p><p>It is well known that the cow is considered as most sacred of all the animals by the Hindus, and the reason assigned for this special veneration is that all the deities dwell in the cow.
</p><p>The <hi>Nandi</hi>, or a bullock made of stone, consecrated in front of the temple of Shiva, the <hi>V&#225;gh</hi> or a tiger at the temple of a goddess and cows and dogs in the temple of Datt&#225;traya are worshipped by the Hindus.

</p><p>It is believed that the people belonging to the caste of Karh&#225;da Br&#225;hmans used to offer human sacrifices to their deity, and therefore nobody relies on a Karh&#225;da Br&#225;hman in these <pb id="pb81" n="81"/>days. There is a proverb in Mar&#225;thi which means that a man can trust even a <hi>Kas&#225;i</hi> or a butcher but not a Karh&#225;da.
</p><p>As they cannot offer human sacrifices in these days, it is said that during the <hi>Navar&#225;tra</hi> holidays, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the first nine days of the bright half of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October), they offer poisoned food to crows, dogs and other animals.<note n="1">School Master, Chawk, Kol&#225;ba.</note>

</p><p>In the Bombay Presidency, and more especially in the Konkan districts, fetish stones are generally worshipped for the purpose of averting evil and curing diseases. In every village stones are found sacred to spirit deities like Bahiroba, Chedoba, Khandoba, Mhasoba, Zoting, Vet&#225;l, Jakh&#225;i, Kok&#225;i, Kalk&#225;i and others. The low class people such as Mah&#225;rs, M&#225;ngs, etc., apply red lead and oil to stones, and call them by one of the above names, and ignorant people are very much afraid of such deities. They believe that such deities have control over all the evil spirits or ghosts. It is said that the spirit Vet&#225;l starts to take a round in a village on the night of the <corr sic="nomoon">no-moon</corr> day of every month, accompanied by all the ghosts. When any epidemic prevails in a village, people offer to these fetish stones offerings of eatables, cocoanuts, fowls and goats.
</p><p>There is a stone deity named Bh&#225;vai at Kokisare in the B&#225;vada State, to whom vows are made by the people to cure diseases.

</p><p>Fire is considered to be holy among the high class Hindus. It is considered as an angel that conveys the sacrificial offerings from this earth to the gods in heaven. It is considered as one of the Hindu deities, and worshipped daily by high class Hindus. A Br&#225;hman has to worship the fire every day in connection with the ceremony <hi>Vaishwadeva</hi>&#8212;oblations of boiled rice and ghi given to the fire.

</p><p>The fire produced by rubbing sticks of the <hi>Pipal</hi> or <hi>Shevari</hi> tree is considered sacred, and it is essentially necessary that the sacred fire required for the <hi>Agnihotra</hi> rites should be produced in the manner described above.
</p><p><hi>Agnihotra</hi> is a perpetual sacred fire preserved in <hi>Agnikunda</hi>,&#8212;a hole in the ground for receiving and preserving consecrated fire.

<pb id="pb83" n="83"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch9" n="IX" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER IX.</head><head><hi>ANIMAL WORSHIP.</hi></head><p>The following animals, birds and insects are respected by the Hindus:&#8212;The cow, bullock, she-buffalo, horse, elephant, tiger, deer, mouse, goat, ants and alligators; and among the birds the following are held sacred<corr sic=".">:</corr>&#8212;Peacock, swan, eagle and <hi>kokil</hi> or cuckoo.
</p><p>Of all the animals the cow is considered to be the most sacred by Hindus. It is generally worshipped daily in the morning for the whole year, or at least for the <hi>Ch&#225;turm&#225;s</hi> or four months beginning from the 11th day of the bright half of <hi>Ash&#225;dha</hi> to the 11th day of the bright half of the month of <hi>K&#225;rtika</hi>; and a special worship is offered to it in the evening on the 12th day of the dark half of <hi><corr sic="Ashwin">Ashvin</corr></hi> (October).
</p><p>The cow is believed to be the abode of all the deities and <hi>rishis</hi>. It is compared with the earth in its sacredness, and it is considered that when it is pleased it is capable of giving everything required for the maintenance of mankind, and for this reason it is styled the <hi>K&#225;ma Dhenu</hi> or the giver of desired objects. It is said that a person who walks round the cow at the time of its delivery obtains the <hi>punya</hi> or merit of going round the whole earth. The cow is even worshipped by the god Vishnu.
</p><p>The cow is considered next to a mother, as little children and the people in general are fed by the milk of a cow. Some women among high class Hindus take a vow not to take their meals before worshipping the cow, and when the cow is not available for worship, they draw in turmeric, white or red powder the cow&#8217;s foot-prints and worship the same. At the completion of the vow it is worshipped, and then given as a gift to a Br&#225;hman. It is considered very meritorious to give a <hi>Goprad&#225;n</hi>&#8212;a gift of a cow along with its calf<corr sic=", ">&#8212;</corr>to a Br&#225;hman. The sight of a cow in the morning is believed by all Hindus to be auspicious.
</p><p>The bullock is respected by the people as it is the favourite vehicle of the god Shiva, and is very useful for agricultural purposes. The <hi>Nandi</hi> or bull is worshipped by Hindus. The bullock is specially worshipped on the 12th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#225;rtika</hi>. When performing the funeral rites of the dead, a bull is worshipped and set free. The bull thus set free is considered sacred by the people, and is never used again for agricultural or any other domestic purposes.
</p><p>In order to avoid calamities arising from the influence of inauspicious planets, Hindus worship the she-buffalo, and offer it as a gift to a Br&#225;hman. The she-buffalo is compared with the <hi>K&#225;l Purusha</hi> or the god of Death, the reason being that Yama is believed to ride a buffalo. The Br&#225;hman who accepts this gift has to shave his moustaches and to undergo a certain penance. The cowherds sometimes worship the she-buffalo. As it is the vehicle of Yama, the buffalo is specially worshipped by people when an epidemic occurs in a village. In certain villages in the Konkan districts the buffalo is worshipped and sacrificed on the same day.
</p><p>The horse is the vehicle of the deity Khandoba of Jejuri. It is worshipped on the <hi>Vijaya Dashami</hi> or the <hi>Dasara</hi> holiday as in former days, on the occasion of the horse sacrifice or <hi>Ashwamedha</hi>.
</p><p>The elephant is the vehicle of the god Indra and is specially worshipped on the <hi>Dasara</hi> day. It is also believed that there are eight sacred <pb id="pb84" n="84"/>elephants posted at the eight directions. These are called <hi>Ashtadik-P&#225;las</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, the protectors of the eight different directions, and they are worshipped along with other deities on auspicious ceremonial occasions, like weddings, thread-girding, etc.
</p><p>The deer and the tiger are considered to be holy by Hindus, and their skins are used by Br&#225;hmans and ascetics while performing their austerities. The deer skin is used on the occasion of thread girding. A small piece of the deer skin is tied to the neck of the boy along with the new sacred thread.
</p><p>The mouse, being the vehicle of the god Ganpati, is worshipped along with that deity on the <hi>Ganesh Chaturthi</hi> day, the fourth day of the bright half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi>.
</p><p>The goat is believed to be holy for sacrificial purposes. It is worshipped at the time of its sacrifice, which is performed to gain the favour of certain deities.
</p><p>The ass is generally considered as unholy by the Hindus, and its mere touch is held to cause pollution. But certain lower class Hindus like the Lon&#225;ris consider it sacred, and worship it on the <hi>Gokul <corr sic="Ashthami">Ashtami</corr></hi> day (8th day of the dark half of <hi>Shr&#225;wan</hi>).
</p><p>The dog is believed to be an incarnation of the deity Khandoba, and it is respected as the favourite animal of the god Datt&#225;traya. But it is not touched by high class Hindus.
</p><p>It is considered a great sin to kill a cat.
</p><p>All domestic animals are worshipped by the Hindus on the morning of the first day of <hi>M&#225;rgashirsha</hi> (December).
</p><p>On this day the horns of these animals are washed with warm water, painted with red colours, and a lighted lamp is passed round their faces. They are feasted on this day as it is considered to be the gala day (<hi>Div&#225;li</hi> holiday) of the animals.
</p><p>Hindus consider it meritorious to feed ants and fish, and to throw grain to the birds. Ants are fed by the people scattering sugar and flour on the ant-hills. It is believed that, by feeding the ants with sugar or flour, a person obtains the <hi>Punya</hi> or merit of <hi>sahasrabhojan</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, of giving a feast to a thousand Br&#225;hmans.
</p><p>Alligators are worshipped as water deities by the Hindus.
</p><p>The peacock is the favourite vehicle of Saraswati, the Goddess of Learning, and it is therefore respected by the people.
</p><p>The swan is the vehicle of Brahma, the god of creation.
</p><p>The eagle is the vehicle of the god Vishnu, and is a favourite devotee of that deity. It is therefore held sacred by Hindus.
</p><p>The cuckoo or <hi>Kokil</hi> is believed to be an incarnation of the goddess P&#225;rwati. This bird is specially worshipped by high caste Hindu women for the period of one month on the occasion of a special festival called the festival of the cuckoos, or <hi>Kokila vrata</hi>, which is held in the month of <hi>Ash&#225;dha</hi> at intervals of twenty years.
</p><p>The crow is generally held inauspicious by Hindus, but as the <hi>manes</hi> or <hi>pitras</hi> are said to assume the form of crows, these birds are respected in order that they may be able to partake of the food offered to the dead ancestors in the dark half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> called <hi>Pitrupaksha</hi>.
</p><p>It is necessary that the oblations given in performance of the funeral rites on the tenth day after the death of a person should be eaten by the crow. But if the crow refuses to touch these oblations, it is believed that the soul of the dead has not obtained salvation; and hence it is conjectured that certain wishes of the dead have remained unfulfilled. The son or the relatives of the dead then take water in the cavity of their right hand, and solemnly promise to fulfil the wishes of the dead. When this is done, the crow begins to eat the food.
</p><p>The harsh sound of a crow is taken as a sure sign of an impending mishap.
</p><p>The dog, cat, pig, ass, buffalo, rat, <hi>bh&#225;lu</hi>, an old female jackal, lizard, and the birds cock, crow, kite, vulture, owl, bat, and <hi>pingla</hi> are considered as unholy and inauspicious by Hindus.

It is a form of the black art. A woman well versed in the <hi>mantras</hi> of <hi>chetak</hi> can do any mischief she chooses. She can kill a child or turn any person into a dog or other animal by the power of her incantations. The <hi>Chetakin</hi> can remove all the hair from the head of a woman, or scatter filth, etc. in a person&#8217;s house, make marks of crosses with marking nuts on all the clothes, or play many other such tricks without betraying a trace of the author of the mischief. The <hi>chetakins</hi> are able to mesmerize a man and order him to do anything they want. A <hi>Chetakin</hi> or witch cannot herself appear in the form of an animal.
</p><p>They follow revolting forms of ceremonies. All witches who have learnt the black art meet at night once a month on the <hi><corr sic="Amav&#225;sya">Am&#225;v&#225;sya</corr></hi> day or no moon day of every month, at a burning ground outside the village. On such occasions they go quite naked, and apply turmeric and red powders to the body and forehead. While coming to the cremation ground they bring on their heads burning coals in an earthen pot called <hi>Kondi</hi>. At this meeting they repeat their <hi>mantras</hi>, and take care that none are forgotten. After completing the repetition of the <hi>mantras</hi>, they go round the village and return to their respective houses. They have no special haunts or seasons.
</p><p>In the Kolh&#225;pur District the woman who is in possession of a <hi>chetak</hi> is called <hi>chetakin</hi>. The <hi>chetak</hi> is said to abide by her orders. It is believed to bring corn and other things from houses or harvesting grounds. It is seen only by its mistress the <hi>chetakin</hi>. The belief that the <hi>chetakins</hi> can turn a person into the form of an animal does not prevail in this district. They do not wander from one place to another. The <hi>chetakin</hi> has to go once a year to the temple of the deity from whom the <hi>chetak</hi> has been brought, and to pay the annual tribute for the use of that <hi>chetak</hi> or servant spirit.<note n="1">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>There are no witches in the Ratn&#225;giri District. It is said that there are some at Kolwan in the Th&#225;na District. They are generally found among Th&#225;kars. Some of them come to the Ratn&#225;giri District, but though no one can tell anything about their powers, ignorant people are very much afraid of them.<note n="2">School Master, Anjarle, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> It is believed that they can turn persons into animals by means of their incantations. The person once charmed by their <hi>mantras</hi> is said to blindly abide by their orders. It is also believed that they can ruin anybody by their magic.
</p><p>There are no witches at R&#225;i in the Th&#225;na District. The woman who can influence evil spirits to do harm to others is called a <hi>Bhut&#225;li</hi>. It is said that the <hi>Bhut&#225;lis</hi> assemble at the funeral ground in a naked state on the full-moon day and on the <hi>Am&#225;v&#225;sya</hi>, or the last day of every month, to refresh their knowledge of the black art.<note n="3">School Master, R&#225;i, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>A witch has dirty habits and observances. The chief sign for detecting a witch or <hi>chetakin</hi> is a foam or froth that appears on the lips of <pb id="pb86" n="86"/>her mouth when she is asleep. The only means to guard against her witchcraft is to remain on friendly terms with her, and not to hurt her feelings on any occasion. People generally keep a watch over the actions of a woman who is suspected to be a witch, and if she is found practising her black art, and is caught red-handed, people then pour into her mouth water brought from the shoe-maker&#8217;s earthen pot or <hi>kundi</hi>. It is believed that, when she is compelled to drink such water, her black art becomes ineffective.<note n="1">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>In the Th&#225;na District it is believed that the skin round the eyes of a witch is always black, her eyes have an intoxicated appearance, her nails are generally parched and have a darkish colour, and the lower portions of her feet seem to be scraped. When any sorcerer gives out the name of such a <hi>Bhut&#225;li</hi>, she is threatened by the people that, should she continue to give trouble in the village, her own black art or another spirit would be set against her; and she then ceases to give trouble.<note n="2">School Master, R&#225;i, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>There are some sorcerers in the Th&#225;na District who can move a small brass cup or <hi>v&#225;ti</hi> by the power of their magic. They can detect a witch by the movement of this vessel. When the brass vessel or <hi>v&#225;ti</hi> reaches the house of a witch, it at once settles upon the witch&#8217;s head. She is then threatened by the people that she will be driven out of the village if found practising her black art.<note n="3">School Master, Padghe, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>In the Kolh&#225;pur District, when the people come to know of the existence of a witch in their village, they take special precautions at the time of harvest. They arrange to harvest a different kind of grain to the one selected for harvesting by the witch. After some time they go to the field of the witch, and discover whether there is a mixture of grain in her field. If they are convinced of the fact, they take further precautions. In order to avoid being troubled by the <hi>chetak</hi>, they keep an old, worn out shoe or sandal and a charmed copper amulet under the eaves at the main door of their houses, or make crosses with marking nut on both sides of a door. At some places <hi>chunam</hi> spots or circles are marked on the front of a house, the object being to guard against the evil effects of the <hi>chetak&#8217;s</hi> tricks.<note n="4">R&#225;o <corr sic="Saheb">S&#225;heb</corr> Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>

At the time of harvesting it is customary with many of the cultivators in the Konkan to place a cocoanut in the field and to thrash it by the first bundle of crop several times before the regular operation of thrashing is begun.

At the time of <hi>Ropani</hi> or transplanting the crops they split a cocoanut, and worship the stone consecrated by the side of the field after besmearing it with red powders, and make a vow of sacrificing a goat for the prosperity of their crops. At the time of harvesting they also worship the heap of new corn and after giving to the deity offerings of cocoanuts, fowls or goats they carry the corn to their houses.<note n="8">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>In the Konkan districts the village deity is invoked to protect the cattle. People offer fowls and cocoanuts in the annual fair of a village deity, and request her to protect their cattle and crops. They have to offer a goat or buffalo to the deity every third year, and to hold annual fairs in her honour. The procession of <hi>bali</hi> is one of the measures adopted for averting cattle diseases.<note n="9">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
<pb id="pb88" n="88"/></p><p>When there was scarcity of rain the Hindus formerly invoked Indra, the god of rain, by means of <hi>Yadnyas</hi> or sacrifices, but such sacrifices are now rarely performed as they are very costly. The general method of ensuring rainfall in these days is to drown the <hi>Lingam</hi> of the god Shiva in water and to offer prayers to that deity.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Fonde">Fonda</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>The following rural rites are intended to ensure sunshine and to check excessive rain. A man born in the month of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi> (March) is requested to collect rain water in the leaf of the <hi>Alu</hi> plant, and the leaf is then tied to a stick and kept on the roof of a house. Burning coals are also thrown into rainwater after passing them between the legs of a person born in the month of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi>.<note n="2">School Master, N&#225;ringre, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>In order to protect the crops from wild pig the people of Umberg&#225;on in the Th&#225;na District post in their fields twigs of <hi>Ayan</hi> tree on the <hi>Ganesh Chaturthi</hi> (fourth day of the bright half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> or September) day every year.<note n="3">School Master, Umberg&#225;on, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>In the Kolh&#225;pur District the deities Tamj&#225;i<corr>,</corr> Tung&#225;i, and W&#225;gh&#225;i are invoked by the villagers for the protection of cattle. When the cattle disease has disappeared the people offer cocoanuts and other offerings to these deities. The potters and the Chudbude Joshis observe the following ceremony for causing rainfall. A <hi>lingam</hi> or phallus of Shiva made of mud is consecrated on a wooden board or <hi>p&#225;t</hi>, and a naked boy is asked to hold it over his head. The boy carries it from house to house and the inmates of the houses pour water over the phallus. The Br&#225;hmans and the high class Hindus pour water on the <hi>lingam</hi> at the temple of the god Shiva continuously for several days. This is called <hi>Rudr&#225;bhisheka</hi>. It is a religious rite in which eleven Br&#225;hmans are seated in a temple to repeat the prayers of the god Shiva.
</p><p>In order to scare noxious animals or insects from the fields, the owners of the fields throw charmed rice round the boundaries of their fields. The figure of a tiger made of dry leaves of sugarcane is posted at a conspicuous place in the fields for protecting the crops of sugarcane.<note n="4">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>Great secrecy is required to be observed on the occasion of the special <hi>puja</hi> of Shiva which is performed on the first day of the bright half of the month of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> (September). This rite is called <hi>Maunya vrata</hi> or silent worship, and should be performed only by the male members of the family. On this day all the members of the family have to remain silent while taking their meals. Women do not speak while cooking, as the food which is to be offered to the god must be cooked in silence.<note n="5">School Master, Chinchani, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>Newly married girls have to perform the worship of Mangala Gauri successively for the first five years on every Tuesday in the month of <hi>Shr&#225;wan</hi> (August), and it is enjoined that they should not speak while taking their meals on that day. Some people do not speak while taking their meals on every Monday of <hi>Shr&#225;wan</hi>, and others make a vow of observing silence and secrecy at their meals every day. All Br&#225;hmans have to remain silent when going to the closet and making water.<note n="6">School Master, Dah&#225;nu, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>Certain persons observe silence at their meals during the period of four months (<hi>Ch&#225;turm&#225;s</hi>) commencing from the 11th day of the bright half of <hi>Ash&#225;dha</hi> (July) to the 11th day of the bright half of <hi>K&#225;rtik</hi> (November). Certain classes of Hindus observe the penance of secrecy in the additional month that occurs at the lapse of every third year.<note n="7">School Master, D&#225;bhol, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Silence is essential at the time of performing certain austerities such as <hi>Sandhya</hi>, worshipping the gods, and the repetition of the <hi><corr sic="Br&#225;hma">Brahma</corr> G&#225;yatri mantra</hi> and other such <hi>mantras</hi>.

</p><p>Secrecy and silence are essential when learning the <hi>mantras</hi> on snakebite, on evil eye and the evil spirit of Vet&#225;l. All followers of the Sh&#225;kta <pb id="pb89" n="89"/>sect must worship the goddess (Durga) very secretly. Silence is also observed by people in welcoming to their homes and worshipping the goddess P&#225;rvati or Gauri in the bright half of <hi>Bh&#225;drapada</hi> every year.<note n="1">School Master, Chauk, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>At V&#225;de in the Th&#225;na District, one day previous to the planting of rice crops the farmer has to go to his field even before day break with five balls of boiled rice, cocoanuts and other things. There he worships the guardian deity of the field and buries the balls of rice underground. He has to do it secretly and has to remain silent during the whole period. He is also forbidden to look behind while going to the field for the purpose.<note n="2">School Master, V&#225;de, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>Secrecy and silence are observed when performing the rites of <hi>Chetuks</hi> and evil spirits or ghosts. Widow remarriages among the lower classes are performed secretly. The pair wishing to be remarried is accompanied by a Br&#225;hman priest and the marriage is performed apart from the house. The priest applies red lead (<hi>Kunku</hi>) to the forehead of the bride and throws grains of rice over their heads and a stone mortar or <hi>p&#225;ta</hi> is touched to the backbone of the bride. The priest then turns his face and walks away silently.<note n="3">R&#225;o S&#225;heb Shelke, Kolh&#225;pur.</note>
</p><p>The <hi>Holi</hi> is a religious festival. It is annually celebrated in memory of the death of K&#225;mdev the God of Love who was destroyed by the god Shankar on the full moon day of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi> (March). The object of this festival appears to have been a desire to abstain from lust by burning in the <hi>Holi</hi> fire all vicious thoughts and desires. As a rule, females do not take any part in this festival.
</p><p>In the Konkan districts the annual festival of <hi>Holi</hi> begins from the fifth day of the bright half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi> (March). Boys from all the localities of a village assemble at a place appointed for the <hi>Holi</hi>. The place appointed for kindling the <hi>Holi</hi> is not generally changed. The boys then go from house to house asking for firewood, and bring it to the <hi>Holi</hi> spot. They arrange the firewood and other combustible articles around the branch of a mango, betelnut or a <hi>S&#225;war</hi> tree in the pit dug out for the purpose and then set it on fire. After kindling the sacred fire they take five turns round the <hi>Holi</hi> accompanied with the beating of drums and raise loud cries of obscene words. After this they play the Indian games of <hi>Aty&#225;p&#225;tya</hi> and <hi>Khokho</hi> and occasionally rob the neighbouring people of their firewood and other combustible articles. At the close of these games they daub their foreheads with sacred ashes gathered from the <hi>Holi</hi> fire. They consider these ashes especially auspicious and carry them home for the use of the other members of their families. This process is continued every night till the close of the fullmoon day. Elderly persons take part in this festival only during the last few days.
</p><p>On the fullmoon day all the males of the village, including old men, start after sunset for the <hi>Holi</hi> spot, collecting on their way pieces of firewood from all the houses in the locality and arrange them in the manner described above. After having arranged the <hi>Holi</hi>, the officiating priest recites sacred verses and the <hi>puja</hi> is performed by the <hi>m&#225;nkari</hi> of the village. This <hi>m&#225;nkari</hi> or <hi>p&#225;til</hi> is either the headman or some other leading person of the village and to him belongs the right of kindling the <hi>Holi</hi> fire first. Some persons kindle a small <hi>Holi</hi> in front of their houses and worship it individually, but they can take part in the public <hi>Holi</hi>. In the towns the <hi>Holis</hi> of different localities are kindled separately while in small villages there is only one for every village.
</p><p>At Vijaydurg in the Ratn&#225;giri District a hen is tied to the top of a tree or a bamboo placed in the pit dug out for kindling the <hi>Holi</hi> fire. The fowl tied to the top of the bamboo is called <hi>Shit</hi>. A small quantity of dry grass is first burnt at the bottom of this tree when the Mah&#225;rs beat their drums. The <hi>Shit</hi> (fowl) is then removed from the tree after it is half burnt and taken by the Mah&#225;rs. The <hi>Holi</hi> fire is then worshipped and kindled by the Gurav. Worshipping and kindling the <hi>Holi</hi> and taking the <hi>Shit</hi> (fowl) are considered as high honours. Occasionally quarrels and differences arise over this privilege and they are decided by the village <hi>Panch</hi>.<note n="4">School Master, Poladpur and Vijaydurg.</note>
<pb id="pb90" n="90"/></p><p>After the kindling of the <hi>Holi</hi> the people assembled there offer to the <hi>Holi</hi> a <hi>Naivedya</hi> (god&#8217;s meal) of <hi>poli</hi>&#8212;a sweet cake made of <hi>Jagri</hi>, wheat flour and gram pulse. Cocoanuts from all the houses in the village are thrown into this sacred fire. Some of these cocoanuts are afterwards taken out of the sacred fire, cut into pieces, mixed with sugar and are distributed among the people assembled as <hi>pras&#225;d</hi> or favoured gift. Lower classes of Hindus offer a live goat to the <hi>Holi</hi>, take it out when it is half burnt and feast thereon.
</p><p>On the night of the fullmoon day and the first day of the dark half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi>, the people assembled at the <hi>Holi</hi> fire wander about the village, enter gardens and steal plantains, cocoanuts and other garden produce. Robbery of such things committed during these days is considered to be pardonable. Some people take advantage of this opportunity for taking revenge on their enemies in this respect.
</p><p>The fire kindled at the <hi>Holi</hi> on the fullmoon day is kept constantly burning till the <hi>Rangpanchami</hi> day <hi>i.e.</hi>, fifth day of the dark half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi>. Next morning <hi>i.e.</hi>, on the first day of the dark half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi>, the people boil water over that fire and use it for the purpose of bathing. It is believed that water boiled on the sacred fire has the power of dispelling all the diseases from the body. People go on dancing in the village and sing songs for the next five days. They generally sing <hi>L&#225;vanis</hi>, a kind of ballad, during this festival. Among these dancers a boy is dressed like a girl and is called <hi>R&#225;dha</hi>. This <hi>R&#225;dha</hi> has to dance at every house while the others repeat <hi>L&#225;vanis</hi>.
</p><p>The second day of the dark half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi> is called <hi>Dhulvad</hi> or dust day when people start in procession through the village, and compel the males of every house to join the party. They thus go to the <hi>Holi</hi> fire and raise loud cries of obscene words throwing mud and ashes upon each other. They afterwards go to the river or a pond to take their bath at noon time and then return to their houses. The third day of the dark half is also spent like the previous one with a slight difference which is that cow dung is used instead of mud. This day is called <hi>Shenwad</hi> day. On the fourth day the Dhunda R&#225;kshahasin (a demon goddess) is worshipped by the people, and the day is spent in making merry and singing obscene songs called <hi>L&#225;vanis</hi>. The fifth day of the dark half is known as <hi>Rangpanchami</hi> day and is observed by the people in throwing coloured water upon each other. Water in which <hi>Kusumba</hi> and other colours are mixed is carried in large quantity on bullock carts through the streets of a city and sprinkled on the people passing through these streets. On this day the sacred fire of the <hi>Holi</hi> is extinguished by throwing coloured water over it. This water is also thrown upon the persons assembled at the <hi>Holi</hi>. The money collected as <hi>post</hi> during this period is utilised in feasting and drinking.
</p><p>At <corr sic="Ibhrampur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr> in the Ratn&#225;giri District the image of cupid is seated in a palanquin and carried with music from the temple to the <hi>Holi</hi> ground. The palanquin is then placed on a certain spot. The place for thus depositing the image of the god is called S&#225;h&#225;n.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Ibhrampur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> At N&#225;ringre there is a big stone called <hi>Holdev</hi> which is worshipped by the people before kindling the <hi>Holi</hi> fire.<note n="2">School Master, N&#225;ringre, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> After the kindling of the sacred fire the palanquin is lifted from the <hi>S&#225;h&#225;n</hi>, and turned round the <hi>Holi</hi> fire with great rejoicings. The palanquin is then carried through the village and is first taken to the house of a <hi>M&#225;nkari</hi>, and then from house to house during the next five days. The inmates of the houses worship the deity in the palanquin and offer cocoanuts and other fruits and make certain vows. The palanquin is taken back to the temple on the fifth day of the dark half of <hi>F&#225;lgun</hi> when on its way <hi>gul&#225;l</hi> or red powder is thrown over the image and on the people who accompany it.<note n="3">School Master, <corr sic="Ibhrampur">Ibr&#225;mpur</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Among high class Hindus the thread girding ceremony of a boy is performed when he attains puberty. The girls are generally married <corr sic="a">at</corr> an early age, and when a girl attains puberty, sugar is distributed among the friends and relatives of her husband. She is then seated in a <hi>Makhar</hi>&#8212;a gaily dressed frame. Dishes of sweets which are brought by the girl&#8217;s <pb id="pb91" n="91"/>parents and the relatives of her husband are given to her for the first three days. She takes her bath on the fourth day accompanied by the playing of music and the beating of drums. Sweetmeats in dishes are brought by the relatives till the day of <hi>Rutushanti</hi> (the first bridal night). The <hi>Garbh&#225;d&#225;n</hi> or <hi>Rutush&#225;nti</hi> ceremony is one of the sixteen ceremonies that are required to be performed during the life of every Hindu. This ceremony is performed within the first sixteen days from the girl&#8217;s attaining her puberty, the 4th, 7th, 9th, 11th and the 13th being considered inauspicious for this purpose. While performing this ceremony the following three rites are required to be observed. They are <hi>Ganpatipujan</hi> or the worship of the god <hi>Ganpati</hi>, <hi>Punhy&#225;havachan</hi> or the special ceremony for invoking divine blessings and <hi>Navagrahash&#225;nti</hi> the ceremony for propitiating the nine planets. The ritual of this ceremony is as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>The husband and the wife are seated side by side on wooden boards to perform the above three rites. The <hi>Kadali pujan</hi> or plantain tree worship is performed by the pair. The sacred fire or <hi>Homa</hi> is required to be kindled. The juice of the <hi>Durwa</hi> grass is then poured into the right nostril of the bride by her husband. This is intended to expel all diseases from the body of the girl and to secure safe conception. They are then seated in a <hi>Makhar</hi>, and presents of clothes, ornaments etc., are made by the parents of the girl and other relatives. After this the husband fills the lap of the girl with rice, a cocoanut, five betelnuts, five dry dates, five almonds, five plantains and five pieces of turmeric. The girl is then carried to a temple accompanied by the playing of music. <corr sic="Agrand">A grand</corr> feast is given to the friends and relatives at the close of this ceremony.
</p><p>The Hindus generally make various kinds of vows in order to procure offspring or with some other such object, and fulfil them when they succeed in getting their desire. The following are the different kinds of vows made. They offer cocoanuts, sugar, plantains and other fruits, costly new dresses and ornaments to the deities, and give feasts to Br&#225;hmans. Special ceremonies called <hi>Laghurudra</hi> and <hi>Mah&#225;rudra</hi> in honour of Shiva the god of destruction are also performed. Sweetmeats such as <hi>pedhas</hi> etc. are offered to the gods in fulfilment of vows. Some people make vows to observe fasts, to feed Br&#225;hmans, and to distribute coins and clothes to the poor; while others hang <hi>torana</hi>-wreaths of flowers and mango leaves&#8212;on the entrance of the temple, and hoist flags over it. Rich people erect new temples to different Hindu deities. Some observe fasts to propitiate the goddess Chandika and worship her during <hi>Navar&#225;tra</hi> the first nine days of the bright half of <hi>Ashvin</hi> (October) and others offer fowls and goats to their favourite deities. Women make it a vow to walk round the <hi>Audumbar</hi> or <hi>Pipal</hi> tree, and to distribute cocoanuts, sugar, jagri, copper or silver equal to the weight of their children.
</p><p>Vows are made by people with the object of securing health, wealth and children and other desired objects such as education etc. They are as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>Performing the worship of Shri Satya N&#225;r&#225;yan, offering clothes and ornaments to the temple deities, hanging bells, constructing a foot path or steps leading to the temple of the special deity.<note n="1">School Master, <corr sic="Fonde">Fonda</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note> Vows are also made to obtain freedom from disease or such other calamities. When any person in the family becomes ill or when a sudden calamity befalls a family an elderly member of the family goes to the temple of a deity and makes certain vows according to his means, fulfilling them as soon as the calamity or disease has disappeared.<note n="2">School Master, Bankavli, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>Vows are usually to perform acts of benevolence. These consist in distributing cocoanut mixed in sugar, giving feasts to Br&#225;hman priests, observing fasts on Saturday, Tuesday and Sunday, offering clothes and ornaments to deities, building new temples and guest houses (<hi>dharmsh&#225;l&#225;s</hi>), digging out new wells and in distributing clothes and food to the poor.<note n="3">School Master, Vijaydurg, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>At Khopoli in the Kol&#225;ba District, people who have no children or whose children die shortly after birth make a vow to the Satw&#225;i deity whose temple is at a short distance from Khopoli. The vow is generally to bring the child to the <hi>darshana</hi> (sight) of the deity and <pb id="pb92" n="92"/>to feed five or more (married) Br&#225;hman pairs. Such vows are fulfilled after the birth of a child. Some worship the god Satya N&#225;r&#225;yan on a grand scale and others propitiate the god Shiva by the ceremony of <hi>Abhisheka</hi> (water sprinkling).<note n="1">School Master, Khopoli, Kol&#225;ba.</note> Some offer nails made of gold or silver to the goddess Shitala after the recovery of a child suffering from small pox. Eyes and other parts of the body made of gold and silver are also occasionally offered in fulfilment of vows. People abstain from eating certain things till the vows are fulfilled.<note n="2">School Master, Poladpur, Kol&#225;ba.</note>
</p><p>Vows are made in times of difficulties and sorrow. The person afflicted with sorrow or misfortune prays to his favourite deity and promises to offer particular things or to perform special ceremonies, and fulfils his vows when his desired objects are attained. The ceremonies commonly observed for these purposes are the special <hi>puj&#225;s</hi> of Satya N&#225;r&#225;yan and Satya Vin&#225;yak. Native Christians make their vows to their saints and Mot-M&#225;vali (Mother Mary) in the taluka of Salsette.<note n="3">School Master, Bassein, Th&#225;na.</note>
</p><p>There is a shrine of the god Shankar at Kanakeshwar a village on the sea side two miles from <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr> in the Ratn&#225;giri District. Many years ago it so happened that a rich Mahomedan merchant was carrying his merchandise in a ship. The ship foundered in a storm at a distance of about two or three miles from Kanakeshwar. When the vessel, seemed to be on the point of sinking the merchant despairing of his life and goods, made a vow to erect a nice temple for the Hindu shrine of Kanakeshwar if he, his vessel and its cargo were saved. By the grace of God the vessel weathered the storm and he arrived safely in his country with the merchandise. In fulfilment of this vow he erected a good temple over the shrine of Shri Shankar at Kanakeshwar, which cost him about rupees six thousand. This temple is in good condition to the present day. Many such vows are made to special deities. When the people get their desired objects they attribute the success to the favour of the deity invoked, but when their expectations are not fulfilled they blame their fate and not the deity.<note n="4">School Master, <corr sic="Mitb&#225;v">Mithb&#225;v</corr>, Ratn&#225;giri.</note>
</p><p>In the Konkan districts there are some persons who practise black art of several kinds such as <hi>Chetak</hi>, <hi>J&#225;ran</hi>, <hi>M&#225;ran</hi> and <hi>Uch&#225;tan</hi>. <hi>Chetak</hi> is a kind of evil spirit brought from the temple of the goddess Ital&#225;i of the Konkan districts. It is brought for a fixed or limited period, and an annual tribute is required to be paid to the goddess for the services.
</p><p>Another kind of black art widely practised in the Konkan districts is known by the name of <hi>Muth m&#225;rane</hi>. In this art the sorcerer prepares an image of wheat flour, and worships it with flowers, incense, etc. A lemon pierced with a number of pins is then placed before the image. The sorcerer begins to pour spoonfuls of water mixed with <hi>Jagri</hi> on the face of the image, and repeats certain <hi>mantras</hi>. Meanwhile, the lemon gradually disappears and goes to the person whose death it is intended to secure. The person aimed at receives a heavy blow in the chest and at once falls to the ground vomitting blood. Sometimes he is known to expire instantaneously. The charmed lemon, after completing its task returns to the sorcerer, who anxiously awaits its return, for it is believed that if the lemon fails to return some calamity or misfortune is sure to occur to him. For this reason the beginner desiring to be initiated into the mystery of this black art has to make the first trial of his <hi>mantras</hi> on a tree or a fowl.
</p><p>Females are also initiated into the mysteries of <hi>J&#225;du</hi> or black art. Such women are required to go to the burning ground at midnight in a naked state, holding in their hands hearths containing burning coals. While on their way they untie their hair, and then begin the recital of their <hi>mantras</hi>. There they dig out the bones of buried corpses, bring them home, and preserve them for practising black art.
</p><p>There is a sect of Hindus known as Sh&#225;ktas who practise the black art. The Sh&#225;ktas worship their goddess at night, make offerings of wine and flesh, and then feast thereon.
