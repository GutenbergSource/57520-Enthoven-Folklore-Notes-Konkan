<HTML><BODY><p>This study of folklore covers Konkan, the Western coastal region of India, roughly between Gujarat and Kerala.

<p>This text is quite hard. Using an oversize format (as the text was republished from a magazine), set in two columns, with countless footnotes (in a mixed-column format), numerous accented letters, and, as a bonus thrown in, a few pages with a few lines of Sanskrit in Devanagari script. For good measure, also expect some Greek and Latin.

<p><b>Footnotes:</b> Numbered footnotes indicate sources, footnotes with symbols indicate clarifications. Both appear at the bottom of the page. Due to the way the OCR has dealt with the text, some footnotes might in a few cases appear at the middle of the page (before the column break), and out-of-order. Please make sure all footnotes appear in order, using numbers for the numbered and [A] [B] [C]... for the symbolic footnotes.

<p>Crooked lines: sometimes, the lines were fairly crooked. Always be on the lookout for missing lines in the OCR, or a missing letter or two at the beginning and end of a line, especially those beginnings and endings that are near the middle of the page.

<p><b>Devanagari:</b> Please transliterate the Devanagari following the following scheme during round P1. If you do not know Devanagari script, but still want to help: quickly skim the page for Devanagari before you start, and if it does, get another page. No problem if you return the page to round, but please not send it to the next without the Devanagari transcribed. The PM is more than willing to provide a transcription, if you indicate the page in the forum.

<p>For those who are up to the challenge, the Devanagari script is somewhat more complex than our alphabet. Vowels have
both an independent and dependent (diacritic) shape called <i>matra</i>, and consonants always include
the short vowel <i>a</i>, unless this is modified by such a vowel sign. When two consonants follow
each other, a complex conjunct letter is used, sometimes by cutting the left part of the first 
consonant, and joining it with the second, sometimes by placing the second consonant under the first,
and sometimes with several special symbols.

<p>For further explanation of the Devanagari script, please see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">article in Wikipedia</a>.

<h2>Table for transliteration of Sanskrit in Devanagari script</h2>

<p><b>Important note:</b> When two letters come together that might be ambiguous, please use {} to disambiguate the characters,
example: &#2309;&#2311; should be transcribed [DV: a{}i]

<p>Please do not forget to type the implicit <hi>a</hi> after the last letter of a word, if it is not explicitly 'cut off' with a virama symbol (otherwise the conversion software will introduce a erroneous virama).
